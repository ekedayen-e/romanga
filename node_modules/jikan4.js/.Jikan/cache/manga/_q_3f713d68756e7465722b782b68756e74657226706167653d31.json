There's magic in such words for those captivated by its spell. They are called 'Hunters'!\" Gon Freecss wants to become a Hunter so he can find his father, a man who abandoned him to pursue a life of adventure. But it's not that simple: only one in one hundred thousand can pass the Hunter Exam, and that is just the first obstacle on his journey. During the Hunter Exam, Gon befriends many other potential Hunters, such as the mysterious Killua; the revenge-driven Kurapika; and Leorio, who aims to become a doctor. There's a world of adventure and peril awaiting, and those who embrace it with open arms can become the greatest Hunters of them all! [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To make matters worse, the virus transforms the infected into mindless monsters who crave human flesh, with some evolving into powerful beings with special powers called \"Rayers.\" The last remaining human settlements live in fear, their survival entirely dependent on the R-X, teenagers who have gained special abilities themselves through contact with Rayers. Wielding lethal weapons and supernatural abilities, the R-X fights to defend what little hope humanity has left. (Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",

Furthermore, this world has another peculiar twist - here men and women live apart, in separated countries, and hunt each other for reproduction. Hunters are mainly woman - because woman in this world are much stronger. In ancient times they drove out men from Manne (The Mainland) to Genda (The Island) and created this sexual segregation. And here is a our hero, a professional hunter, not feared by women, who hunts them not for fun and money. But to finally settle down, and find a woman to continue his bloodline. The final hunt begins! (Source: VNDB)",

Since he can't prove anything, his belief has earned him the mocking nickname \"Youkai Hunter\" from his colleagues. One day, two men from Ootori-chou come to visit him. They're planning to promote tourism by reviving their town's old, traditional \"Demon Festival,\" which has been discontinued for the past century. They're basing the festival on Hieda's research, although they're changing a few details to make it flashier for modern sightseers. Although Hieda is troubled by the history of human death associated with the festival, he agrees to attend as an advisor. When the Demon Festival turns out to be much more 'historically accurate' than anyone ever dreamed, it will take all of Hieda's knowledge and courage to help set things right!

In the midst of his troubles, he was attacked and killed by an unidentified group. And when he opened his eyes, he had returned to the past of 10 years ago. Though he tries to become a hunter again and raise his rank, his skills were all sealed by the karma of his previous life. In order for that to be released, he needs to work as a \"Dungeon Cleaner,\" which is infamous for being extremely tough in this industry?! But this cleaner, he's different! Not only monsters—troublesome hunters, superiors only taking up positions after they're hired out of nepotism, and even people who will be colleagues with him. He's making a complete mess to clean everything up. The ex-hunter, who is stronger than the current hunters, and his crazy cleaning begins! (Source: Yeongsang Note, translated)",

Enter a world where demons seen only in dreams are real, oceans swallow cities, and the powers of the mind are preferable to guns. It is here in the \"Demon City\" that Kyoya Izayoi, master of the rare martial art of nenpo, wields the mythical sword Ashura in defense of beautiful Sayaka Katagiri. As the evil Dark Order and the Super Soldiers of the Special Abilities Task Force clash in a race to find the one believed to be God, Kyoya saves a member of the SATF—and lands himself smack in the middle of a mess. Meanwhile, members of the Dark Order ambush Sayaka. Can Kyoya slay the beasts and save the girl? Will Kyoya help the SATF defeat the Dark Order and their plan to destroy the world? It's nature versus the supernatural! (Source: ADV)",

Before his master, Gurelli Jescar, met an untimely death, he taught Shiki the most important skill of being a Monster Hunter: teamwork. Several years later, wielding his dual blades, Shiki heads to Akayama Town's Guild to find himself a partner. He takes a liking to the unwilling Irie Jescar, a girl notorious for rejecting any attempt at camaraderie. But her attitude soon changes; when Shiki saves her from a Rathian attack, he reveals that he has the mark of a Forbidden Hunter—meaning he is free to hunt—and that he has only one goal: to fight the legendary Miogaruna. Irie is surprised that Shiki believes in the Miogaruna, as the only other person who believed in its existence was her late father, Gurelli. Motivated by the discovery of their shared connection, Irie and Shiki team up to fulfill Gurelli's lifelong dream. Thus, the two embark on their legendary journey, gaining allies and rivals while hunting monsters in the grand quest to find the Miogaruna. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Seur-Chong is a hunter with the Dragon's Curse, a condition which gives him incredible strength and stamina, but is slowly killing him. A mercenary, he cares only for money. But as he becomes enmeshed in the intrigue surrounding those who hire the hunters, he finds himself fighting for a cause more noble than anything he'd ever imagined. Of course if he's lucky, he just might come away with a profit and a cure to his curse, as well... (Source: Tokyopop)",

          "synopsis": "Spirits roam the land in the mountainous country of Donghye. Some live peacefully alongside human beings, whereas others prey on the innocent. Solitary swordsman Sehui Han travels the land hunting down spirits and ghosts that plague the lives of ordinary folk. He is aided by a powerful spirit called Black Tiger, who grants Sehui strength in return for being allowed to feed on the spirits they meet. One day, Sehui encounters a young spirit called the Hwimori. Though she appears to be an innocent child, government soldiers are on her trail, determined to track her down. Empathizing with her plight, Sehui embarks upon a journey to restore her name and memories...but what will they find at the end of their road? (Source: Tappytoon)",
