          "synopsis": "Fed up of being called a \"clumsy good-for-nothing\" by her classmates, Hana Aoi resolves to change by answering a job advertisement for part-time work at a local zoo. Despite its gaudy design and lack of visitors, the derelict zoo is a paradise to Hana who cannot wait to spend her evenings looking after cute animals. That is, until she bumps into a giant, anthropomorphic rabbit! Hana soon discovers that the rabbit is actually the zoo director, Shiina, a human cursed by a ghost with the strange ability to transform normal animals into humanoids. In order to get his original body back, Shiina must prove his love of animals by making his zoo the best in the world. But, with a principle to only do fun things, caring for animals is too much of a bore. This is where Hana comes in. Locked into employment—and secrecy—by the egotistical rabbit, Hana realizes that if she is to have any hope of changing herself, she must first survive a world in which the line between man and beast can no longer be distinguished.

          "synopsis": "As a child, Masahiro Setagawa hated the idea of heroes, as no one had ever attempted to save him from his own miserable existence. As a teenager, he became an errand boy for delinquents and had no desire to change his ways before meeting the \"Bear Killer,\" Kousuke Ooshiba, a man with no qualms about beating up evildoers. After discovering his identity, Setagawa became Kousuke's underling and also struck up a friendship with his brother Kensuke. A few years later, the relationship between Kousuke and Setagawa has not evolved beyond their initial master and subordinate arrangement. But after Setagawa sees Kensuke with his boyfriend Asaya Hasekura, and a misunderstanding arises on the part of Kousuke, Setagawa realizes that his feelings for his mentor may not be as clear cut as previously thought.

          "synopsis": "One day, a four-year-old boy came to a sudden realization: the world is not fair. Eighty percent of the world's population wield special abilities, known as \"quirks,\" which have given many the power to make their childhood dreams of becoming a superhero a reality. Unfortunately, Izuku Midoriya was one of the few born without a quirk, suffering from discrimination because of it. Yet, he refuses to give up on his dream of becoming a hero; determined to do the impossible, Izuku sets his sights on the elite hero training academy, UA High. However, everything changes after a chance meeting with the number one hero and Izuku's idol, All Might. Discovering that his dream is not a dead end, the powerless boy undergoes special training, working harder than ever before. Eventually, this leads to him inheriting All Might's power, and with his newfound abilities, gets into his school of choice, beginning his grueling journey to become the successor of the best hero on the planet. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Living in a superhuman society, it's hard to feel special. Even more so when the spotlight only shines on professional heroes, those legally authorized to use their special powers known as \"Quirks\" in public for the greater good. Kouichi Haimawari grew up aspiring to be a hero, but with a mediocre Quirk like \"sliding\" that ties him to the ground, he soon came to the conclusion that he could only ever admire them from below. Despite this, Kouichi finds contentment in using his Quirk to carry out day-to-day good deeds, such as returning lost items and helping the elderly cross the street. However, Kouichi's tame life takes a swing into the turbulent when he is rescued from a back alley brawl by \"Vigilante,\" or illegal hero, Knuckleduster. Seeing hero potential in Kouichi, Knuckleduster enlists his help in tracking down the source of a dangerous drug known as \"Trigger\" that boosts the user's Quirk at the expense of their rationality. Set in a time before the events of the original story, Vigilante: Boku no Hero Academia Illegals follows Kouichi as he chooses to don the reputation of a villain and become a Vigilante, operating in the shadow of the law to prevent crimes from taking to the surface.
