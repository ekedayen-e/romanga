One such Koh-Boku, Kyuu-san, has Kashiwagi by his side, a super-elite who is a dozen years his junior. Even though he thinks that he really should push his junior to stand on his own, he couldn't bear to be parted from the pleasure of working passionately every day with Kashiwagi... but one day, their cozy relationship changed...?!

          "synopsis": "Slavery—a notorious system where a master asserts absolute dominance over their slave—has had no place in modern Japan. However, this all changes when a device called the Slave Control Method (SCM) spreads among some people. This nefarious device allows its users to make a slave of those it is used upon, making it possible for one to deliver their sweetest revenge or fulfill their immoral desires. But there is a catch: two owners must challenge each other to a game, with the winner gaining absolute control over the loser. Two such users are casual part-timer Eiya Arakawa and the carefree Yuuga Oota. After a confrontation between them, Oota convinces Arakawa to become his \"insurance,\" so she can regain control over him in case he loses to another SCM owner. In this game there are no rules, all underhanded methods are at the disposal of SCM users. No one from office workers to popular club hosts are safe, as they may all end up as slaves regardless...

The basic premise is that Kodaka, a rude looking and easily misunderstood transfer student catches a glimpse from a conversation between Sena (the most popular girl on school) and \"her friend\" Renka (a character from a visual novel); after a short discussion followed, Sena decides to give it a try and make some friends with Kodaka's help. This is a tweak from the original premise, on which Kodaka catches Yozora speaking to her \"air friend\", and is Yozora the one who decides to start practicing how to make friends with Kodaka's help.

After he confessed, Sensei refused to accept him because he was dumped once by a student before. Will Ookawa’s determination and his strong love convince Sensei? 2) I Want to Know More About You Tsuruoka is very serious when it comes to Ookawa as both a boyfriend and a Teacher. When Tsuruoka happens to over hear a conversation between Iwase, Ookawa's homeroom teacher, and another teacher concerning Ookawa's future, he becomes more deeply troubled. With his growing concerned mixed with his own anxiety, how will he tell Ookawa? 3) Route 17 Runner Tsuji is confessed to by his kouhai, star athlete Tenranishi, but without waiting for an answer, Tenranishi tells him to forget about it and runs off! 4) Hope This Can Be Forever Hiromi's cool exterior hides his growing feelings for Yutaka, but suppressing his emotions where his childish kouhai is concerned is getting more and more difficult. The day is coming when Hiromi won't be able to hold back anymore... 5) The Feeling of Love Seiji always though a charming smile would get him out of trouble, so he grins idiotically all time. But classmate Inoue only wants to see Seiji smile for real. 6) The Four Seasons at the Toda Flower Shop Florist Shougo has been alone since his wife Kana died five years ago. Well, almost alone, her annoying and cheerful nephew Takao is determined to stay close to Shougo, no matter what! Takao's love is definitely more than uncle/nephew, but what about Shougo's feelings? 7) Mint Candy Miyahara's wedding is a reunion for former college classmates stoic Kuze and light-hearted Takeda. Even knowing how cool Kuze is, Takeda is still surprised at his nonchalance, since Takeda always thought that Kuze had a crush on Miyahara. (Source: Baka-Updates Manga)",

          "synopsis": "Otoboku 2 begins about two years after Mizuho's graduation. The main protagonist Chihaya Mikado was truant at his school because of harassment in the school and of a distrust in men. His mother cannot bear to watch him be in trouble, so she makes him transfer to Seio Girl's School, her old school. He dresses as a girl and introduces himself as Chihaya Kisaraginomiya. Chihaya meets another protagonist Kaoruko Nanahara, who once rescued him from a playboy, and he begins to live in the dormitory building. He becomes the focus of public attention due to his attractive face and figure, and due to high grades at studies. (Source: Wikipedia)",
