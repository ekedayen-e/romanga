The academy is home to squads that hunt down and kill, destroy, or otherwise render harmless magical practitioners and artifacts. The 35th Test Platoon is a band of misfits who don't seem to fit in anywhere else. Each member is a specialist with a focus on a different aspect of operations. The squad may become the greatest team ever, but first they must overcome their greatest obstacle: each other. (Source: MU)",

          "synopsis": "On a chilly Christmas Eve, the exorcist Evan comes upon a small and unkempt demon peeping in on a family's Christmas festivities. Rightfully leery of exorcists, the demon panics and attempts to run away. However, enamored by her childlike appearance and mannerisms, Evan decides to drag her to his home. The terrified demon—now named Lily—begs for her life, but to her surprise, Evan washes her and treats her gently. When he is done, he presents a holiday meal and finally a teddy bear to her as a gift. Touched by the kindness that Evan shows, Lily discovers that relationships with humans aren't always volatile, and the pair's bond quickly begins to grow. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The humans suffered massive casualties as a mysterious phenomenon called \"Twilight\" took over the world. In that world, there exists a certain average boy. One day, unfairly abandoned by his party members, he's consumed by the Twilight. Two years pass. In the uninhabitable twilight, that boy struggles like mad to survive. Eventually, he returns to the barrier city with the powerful skills he acquired in the Twilight. What awaits him next? No matter what, he moves forward, believing that a blue sky awaits him beyond.

Having found its way to Dunwich. Massachusetts, Dr. Taima and his lovely assistant, Maki Togetsu, make their way to America to combat this repulsive plague that turns people into rapacious monsters that devour anything within their grasp! When an ally joins dr. Taima, how will these taimashin masters bait their prey into their piercing trap? Find out in the story that chronicles their campaign against evil, in Taimashin!",

          "synopsis": "One year has passed since the Chaos Arena was destroyed, Asagi and Sakura were presently on an abandoned street on a man-made island that floated on top of Tokyo Bay. It was an enormous box-shaped island built by the government and referred to as “Tokyo Kingdom”. There was hope that it would become a second city center floating at sea, but it had failed to attract businesses. The only way of getting to and from the island was through Honshu Island over the 10 kilometer Tokyo Kingdom bridge. Unfortunately, this narrow route was the means in which the inhabitants of hell found their way onto the island, luring anarchists, criminals, and even illegal immigrants there, transforming the streets of the sea bound city into a world-renowned haven for danger. However abandoned the streets were, order did exist in such a place despite it being a breeding place of crime. There was a business district at the heart as well as one of Asia's greatest prostitute grottoes. Whether or not it was only the strong who survived, the viability of living there required one not to be careless in making friends with the strong. (Source: Dark Translations)",
