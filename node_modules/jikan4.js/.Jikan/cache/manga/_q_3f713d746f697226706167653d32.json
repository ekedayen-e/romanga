But their mother's death isn't the only disaster that happened in that restaurant - for example, there's a thief who comes all the time, but never steals anything. Then one day, a man helped them chase out a client who was picking a fight. They let him lodge in their house as a token of gratitude, but he is a mysterious man with unclear past who never talks much about anything..!?

No longer having a place to live, the girls roam around the city on their half-track motorcycle, ever in search of resources to sustain their vagabond lifestyle. Despite the bleak future ahead of them, the duo still finds ways to entertain themselves throughout this melancholic journey. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou takes place in a barren world during the harsh winter season. As the happy-go-lucky Yuuri and the serious Chito hopelessly search for a sign of civilization, their expedition may in fact become humanity's last tour. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "She may dress ordinarily, come from a poor family, and work on a farm—but 17-year-old Lina Randall is no peasant. In fact, she is the daughter of a Count. But because of droughts in recent years, her family's once-thriving agricultural territory was ruined, leaving them with a considerable debt they had to sell their possessions off to pay back. On a day like any other, Lina receives a letter from the King stating that a royal banquet will be held to find a bride for the third prince, and all eligible female suitors are invited. A week later, Lina reluctantly arrives in her unspectacular attire at a room full of beautiful women, all vying to stand beside the prince, Lord Gilberto. Upon laying eyes on the prince for the first time, Lina is immediately taken aback, his aura far too stunning and radiant for her to behold! Thinking she could never capture the prince's heart, Lina hopes to return home as soon as possible. But—as fate would have it—when Lina is selected as one of the final five contenders, she cannot help but become ever more intertwined with the dazzling prince and his royal affairs.

Between Yuna's princess-like elegance and Rinka's prince-like charm, all their classmates see them as the ideal couple. Yotsuba Hazama is no exception to that, but she is exceptional in another way: she's somehow managed to become fast friends with both of them! Having the whole school's favorite ship as her two best friends isn't exactly easy, though. Not only does it make everyone treat Yotsuba like a particularly obnoxious third wheel, it makes her feel like one too! Or at least it does, until one day, Yuna asks her out. And then Rinka asks her out too! And Yotsuba, whose social anxiety never seems to kick in until after she's already messed something up...says yes to both of them, without sparing so much as a single thought for the consequences. Oops! Now Yotsuba only has one choice: keep her accidental two-timing under wraps and make both of her new girlfriends as happy as she possibly can! (Source: J-Novel Club)",

An unlikely friendship begins when a delinquent picks up a timid businessman stranded on the side of the road. Though they can’t understand each other there is something they each gain from this new, strange relationship. Later, a teenager hires out help to break up his ex-girlfriend’s new relationship, but his new accomplice isn’t quite what she seems. In Nazi Germany, an artist is caught in treason when his son drops a book of paintings. And in England, a street urchin is given a special job, and while it seems simple there is a dark secret to it that could mean disaster for his friend. (Source: DMG)",
