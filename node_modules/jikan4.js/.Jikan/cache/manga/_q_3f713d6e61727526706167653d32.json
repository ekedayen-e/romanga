She clings to them with the hope that she will one day experience a love story of her own—one that will sweep her off her feet and make her heart flutter. However, reality is often disappointing. When a classmate from junior high confesses his feelings to her, Yuu finds that she feels nothing. Unable to give him an answer, she becomes convinced that she is unable to fall in love. One day, on her way to the student council room, Yuu encounters the council's president, Touko Nanami, turning down a confession from a boy. Inspired by Touko's confidence, Yuu turns to her for help. But when Touko becomes the next person to confess to Yuu, she is confused, yet her heart is set aflutter. Yagate Kimi ni Naru is a manga about grappling with love and growing up. Will Yuu's long-awaited romance finally begin? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Since most of his relatives have been vocally opposed to taking him in, Yuu is used to moving from one family to another until he starts living with his mother's cousin. While he does not treat Yuu as a hassle, his uncle has one inarguable condition: Yuu must stay away from the storehouse. However, Yuu cannot avoid going inside the storehouse any longer when his uncle ends up in the hospital. What he finds there both frightens him and fills him with awe. A voluptuous woman with horns and hooves towers over him, promising to fulfill Yuu's wish in exchange for what he holds dearest. Never having known true filial affection, Yuu wishes for a family—but what he gets far exceeds his expectations. His deal with a demon might just land him in serious trouble!

          "synopsis": "Eiji Urashima is just an ordinary university student like everyone else. His college career consists of boozing with his friends and trying to get a girlfriend. On October 23rd, he returns home after a pleasant night of drinking and goes to bed. To his surprise, when Eiji wakes up, a gorgeous girl from his university, Kyouka Yukimura, is lying beside him—claiming to be his girlfriend. Having no recollection of the event, Eiji goes along with the flow until he's faced with more nonsensical events that took place in the last few days. Walking alongside his friend, Kashiwagi, he cannot help but ask the most intuitive question in his mind: isn't today the 24th? \"Eiji, what are you saying? Today's the 27th.\" Three days have passed, yet Eiji cannot recall a thing. The situation takes a dire turn when a magazine writer exposes Eiji's deepest secret in front of Kyouka: he is the son of a serial killer. As his life is thrown into a spiral of disarray, he embarks on a journey to resolve the mess of the last three days and get Kyouka to accept his past. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite Nao winning every time, Kyousuke refuses to give up, hoping to defeat him in the future. One day, however, at the age of 17, Nao is struck by a sudden illness and is hospitalized for several weeks, only to return as an \"emerged\" female. Much to the dismay of Kyousuke who is afraid of women, Nao easily accepts the situation and is ready to continue living life as a girl. In a world where a gender shifting mechanism maintains a fixed male-to-female ratio, Kanojo ni Naru Hi is the tale of Nao as a boy who has switched genders, adapting to the change in his circumstances.

On the verge of death, she begs God to be reborn surrounded by nothing but books. Her wish is fulfilled, albeit not how she expected: Urano is reincarnated as Myne—a sickly five-year-old child with an ardent desire to read—in another world where the upper class controls knowledge, and only the privileged have access to written works. As a commoner, Myne is distraught that she will never be able to find what she is yearning for. To obtain books, Myne decides she should make them herself. Currently, she is but a kid thrust into an unknown place—but nothing will not stop Myne from achieving her goal. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "\"God, even if I'm reincarnated, please let me keep reading lots of books...\" This was the dying wish of Urano Motosu, a university student who loved to read books, no matter the genre or type. She treasured books to such an extent that she aimed to graduate with a librarian's certificate—which she was on the verge of acquiring if it weren't for an earthquake that caused her bookshelf to collapse and crush her to death. Though she may not have been granted the job of her dreams, she was at least granted another chance at life. Awakening as a frail five-year-old girl named Maine, she finds herself in a foreign medieval city populated by people with strange-colored hair. This new world fascinates Maine, but her lack of strength and the low status of her family and shelter disappoints her. To make things worse, she realizes that public literacy is low and books are rare and expensive in this city. Although Maine's past life has ended, her love for books has not—and thus begins the story of this bookworm's quest to make her own books. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "\"From a dying planet shall come the children of light...\" While on vacation on a small island, young Shiina Tamai dives under the water near an old shrine and discovers an unearthly starfish-like creature. She nearly drowns but is rescued by the silent, wide-eyed little animal, who Shiina befriends and names Hoshimaru. To Shiina's surprise and delight, the creature changes shape, lets Shiina stand on him, and the two fly off into the clouds. But what looks to be a young girl's ultimate fantasy soon takes a darker turn as Shiina and Hoshimaru become entangled in a struggle between rival extraterrestrial factions who battle in the skies upon huge alien beasts called Shadow Dragons, with the fate of Earth hanging in the balance.

          "synopsis": "Middle school student Rinichi Sagara has always been troubled by his short stature and feminine features. Criticisms of his appearance easily provoke him into fights, and as a result, he has earned himself a reputation as a surly and scary individual. Most of his classmates are unwilling to approach him, except for the tirelessly kind Aya Kurokawa and Yuu Narumi, who is Sagara's rival for Kurokawa's affections. One day, while the two boys are once again arguing over the girl they like, Sagara suddenly collapses. When Sagara regains consciousness, he discovers that he has transformed into a girl. In this world, to maintain an equal ratio of males to females, some boys randomly change sex through a phenomenon known as \"emergence.\" Refusing to accept his new status, Sagara becomes even more determined to behave as masculine as possible. Despite his efforts, both Kurokawa and Narumi soon learn of his secret—and this knowledge dramatically upsets the previous dynamic of their love triangle.

          "synopsis": "Throughout elementary school, Sayaka Saeki has prided herself on being the ideal child. By achieving good grades, participating in various extracurricular activities, and demonstrating model etiquette, she thought her life was going exactly as planned. However, after receiving a romantic confession from a girl in her swim class, Sayaka realizes how emotions can defy her logical, straightforward thinking. Wanting to cooperate rather than compete with peers at the start of middle school, Sayaka's shift in perspective leads her to befriend her senior Chie Yuzuki. As the two form a gentle bond, Yuzuki confesses her feelings to Sayaka, who reciprocates her affection in hopes of learning the significance of love. Despite sacrificing her devotion to academics, their relationship ends, leaving Sayaka scarred with resentment. Swearing to never let her feelings take control of her life again, Sayaka vows to revive her independence in high school. But when class representative Touko Nanami captures her eye, Sayaka must settle her struggle between accepting her genuine self or pursuing her logical way of life. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They were just a group of one-man teams; not interested in cooperation at all. Any failures were blamed on the jester. Dylan, who was disgusted with such companions and was sick of playing as their comedic foil, happily accepted being kicked out. The heroes didn't know. After saving them many times over with his magic tricks, the level 99 jester can change his job title to that of a Great Sage. \"Life, how about a rewrite?\" He's done being the clown.
