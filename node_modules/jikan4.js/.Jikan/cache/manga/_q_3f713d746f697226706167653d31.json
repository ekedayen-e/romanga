It's not like he chose to be born into money, but between his father's demands to uphold the family's reputation and his classmates' constant gossiping, the only respite he has is Dowon Baek, his psychiatrist. But everything changes when the mysterious Dowon inducts Hyeon into his secret other life. Infatuated with Dowon and driven by his self-destructive instincts, Hyeon is drawn into a world of twisted desire and pleasure. (Source: Lezhin Entertainment)",

          "synopsis": "The series is set many years after a devastating war, which killed 80% of the Earth's population. Earth is being watched by a group of beings known as The Third from a city called Hyperius. They are named after a red jewel-like eye on their forehead (Space Eye) that serves as a port for data access and other types of communication. These beings are committed to protecting the humans from harm. One of the main ways is to protect the humans is to control the amount of \"technos\" or technology that the humans have access to, known as the \"technos taboo\". Human found using forbidden technos could be killed by The Third's best \"autoenforcer\" an AI robot named Bluebreaker. It follows the adventures of Honoka, a 17 year old girl who is human, but was born with a blue third eye as well. The Third found that she could not interface with the rest of The Third and so declared her a mutation and left her with human parents. Her blue eye enables her to see Chi and use it to find cloaked enemies and sense the emotions of all living things. Honoka is a jack-of-all-trades who travels throughout the barren earth with the help of a sand tank operated by Bogie, an AI guardian given to her by her grandfather. She earns a living by doing various jobs with the tank like ridding areas of oversized spiders and ants and escorting or transporting clients. One night while traveling through the desert, she comes upon a strange man named Iks. He arrived on the planet for a purpose which is not clear until the last episode. The Third is also nervous about his arrival and fears he may seek to harm the humans. In order to understand the world more Iks contracts with Honoka to accompany her for most of her travels. During travel or at night, she recites poems by a writer named \"Dona Myfree\" (exact spelling unknown at this time).",

Her ability to randomly time loop makes her professionally successful but also renders all relationships meaningless. What's the point when she'll have to restart everything at some point? That all changes when Joonwon, her annoying new boss, reveals that he can time loop too. Though she cringes at the mere sight of him, he's also the only person who understands her. Will they learn how to find solace in each other, or will their professional friction mess up their one chance at love? (Source: Tappytoon)",

Little does he know that the bat is in fact magical. It enables him to hit every pitch, but on one condition: everytime he uses it, he has to pay money to the mysterious store. Kohnan's team reaches the championship game, where they face another school, Ougane. On the opposing team is Kazuhisa Inao, who has a baseball glove that is also magical, and can throw the fastest pitches. Like Shigeo, he must also pay for this. But, unlike Shigeo (who has to work very hard for every yen), Kazuhisa can afford this cost. (Source: Wikipedia)",
