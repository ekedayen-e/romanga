          "synopsis": "Bulma, a headstrong 16-year-old girl, is on a quest to find the mythical Dragon Balls—seven scattered magic orbs that grant the finder a single wish. She has but one desire in mind: a perfect boyfriend. On her journey, Bulma stumbles upon Gokuu Son, a powerful orphan who has only ever known one human besides her. Gokuu possesses one of the Dragon Balls, it being a memento from his late grandfather. In exchange for it, Bulma invites Gokuu to be a companion in her travels. By Bulma's side, Gokuu discovers a world completely alien to him. Powerful enemies embark on their own pursuits of the Dragon Balls, pushing Gokuu beyond his limits in order to protect Bulma and their growing circle of allies. However, Gokuu has secrets unbeknownst to even himself; the incredible strength within him stems from a mysterious source, one that threatens the many people he grows to hold dear. As his prowess in martial arts flourishes, Gokuu attracts stronger opponents whose villainous plans could collapse beneath his might. He undertakes the endless venture of combat training to defend his loved ones and the fate of the planet itself. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
          "background": "Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga series of all time, with over 230 million copies sold worldwide with 157 million in Japan alone, making it the third all-time best selling manga as of 2015, and the #1 manga series not currently publishing. The series is often credited for the \"Golden Age of Jump\" where the magazine's circulation was at its highest. VIZ Media serialized the manga in English from March 1998 to March 2005 in monthly comic book anthology format; and was later collected into traditional tankobon format volumes from March 12, 2003 to June 6, 2006. To closer follow the English anime localization, the series is split; in which volumes 17-42 are titled Dragon Ball Z and renumbered as volumes 1-26. Other releases by VIZ include the large format VIZ Big Edition, kanzenban cover based 3-in-1 Edition, and a Full Color Edition of chapters 195-245. Other English publishers include Madman Entertainment in Australia/New Zealand, and the now defunct Gollancz Manga (distribution rights transferred to VIZ) in the United Kingdom. The series is also published in Spanish by Planet DeAgostini Cómics and in French by Glénat Editions.",

His wife, Chi-chi, wants him to get a job, but all he wants to do is train and fight stronger enemies. Elsewhere in the universe, the God of Destruction, Beerus, and his attendant Whis are traveling from planet to planet in search of food and entertainment. After blowing up some hapless victims, Beerus is reminded of a man from his dreams with the moniker \"Super Saiyan God,\" or something like that... The God of Destruction sets his sights on Earth to track down this mysterious man! Maybe this will give Goku something to do? (Source: VIZ Media)",

The Dark Empire having revived their leader, Mechikabura, plan to retrieve artifacts known as the Dark Dragon Balls, which have scattered across time and space, in order to restore him back into the prime of his youth. However, the Dark Dragon Balls have merged with past villains, giving them new found might. Now it is up to Xeno Trunks, along with new allies such as Xeno Goku and Xeno Vegeta from stopping their plans from coming to fruition. (Source: Dragon Ball Wiki)",

          "synopsis": "In a fantasy world inspired by ancient China, thirteen clans rule the land, and the Rat Clan is the weakest. Rueiin, the princess of the Rat Clan, is summoned to the land of the dominating Dragon Clan along with the princesses of the other tribes. The Dragon King seeks a bride, and they are all candidates! Instead of vying for the Dragon King's favor, though, Rueiin takes the chance to lose herself in the palace's enormous library—a place she can read to her heart's content, since she's driven by an insatiable curiosity. It's there that she's \"found\" by the Dragon King himself, who immediately kisses her and claims she's the one for him?! A fantastical love story begins! (Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

As the Han Dynasty collapses, two mighty warriors—Zhang Fei and Guan Yu—stand strong against the tide of rebellion. But because these fighters are female, their dreams of fighting in the Imperial army are nothing but dreams...until they find a patron and like-minded brother in Liu Bei, an idealistic descendant of royalty with dreams of his own. Forging a pact, the three form a volunteer army dedicated to restoring peace, which means first defeating three deceptively adorable sisters who oppose them, and who have their own, definitely cuter, plan for China's future... One thing's for sure—history's about to get a makeover! (Source: Tokyopop)",

          "synopsis": "In order to gain a professorship at Meishin University Medical Center—with the greater goal of reforming the corrupt Japanese medical system—Dr. Akira Katou decides to focus her newest research paper on one of the most difficult surgical procedures in the world: the Batista. The Batista, otherwise known as a reduction left ventriculoplasty, can only be conducted by those with the highest degree of skill. Because it has never been accomplished in Japan, a successful Batista will be key to securing Katou's candidacy for professorship. However, she will need an incredible team to pull it off—her first recruit being the genius surgeon, Dr. Ryutaro Asada. Having once witnessed Asada's extraordinary surgical skills in person, Katou believes that he will be a valuable teammate. Things don't go according to plan, though, as Asada quickly causes trouble at the hospital, continuously defying the system in place. With her career on the line, Katou must find a way to keep the other surgeon in check before he derails her agenda. But if stopping him means conforming to the very system she seeks to destroy, can it really be worth it? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
