The rules are simple: seduce salary men into vulnerable positions before taking off with their money and dignity. Together with an aggressive and competitive group of high school dropouts, 16-year-old Kizuna Etou plays The Game, but begins to have second thoughts. Unfortunately, leaving isn't an option; the final rule of The Game states that no one is allowed to quit. Ever. However, after one of her night-time escapades, Kizuna is approached by a persistent woman with a captivating job offer: model in the nude for the taciturn painter Yusei Asai. Though at first dismissive of each other, these individuals slowly begin to change their stubborn habits and open their hearts to one another. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Beginning of 16th century, Alexandra was captured by slave traders from Ukraine during one of their many raids. When the traders arrived in Greece to sell the female slaves, a young handsome man named Mateus bought her and promised to give her true freedom. He hired countless teachers, scholars, and palace ladies to train her into the most perfect woman of her time. Mateus’s kindness has caused Alexandra to deeply fall in love with him, and she secretly wishes to be his concubine. But cruel fate! Mateus has already promised her to his best friend... Suleiman the Great, Emperor of the Ottoman Empire! Mateus promised Alexandra of true freedom, but where is freedom when she is in another man’s harem and can only look at the one she loves from afar? Not willing to endure agony, Alexandra promises herself that one day, she will free both of them from their bird cages... but Mateus is the Grand Vizier, power only second to the Emperor himself. So Alexandra must become the most influential concubine in order to have any hope... which also means, bearing Suleiman’s son. However, Suleiman already has a son by another concubine, and this woman is determined to keep her son as the only prince. Hence begins the story of a slave to an empress of the greatest empire of all time – Alexandra, the woman who would one day be known as Roxelana, Empress of the Ottoman Empire.

          "synopsis": "On a rainy day almost a month ago, Kumo Shirasagi disappeared without a trace. In hopes of finding her, a group of six classmates convenes to search the Bird Forest, an abandoned amusement park on a remote hill in the countryside. Among these students is Gin Kurobe, a boy whose reasons for coming are as mysterious as his habit of muttering under his breath. The group's search takes them to the foreboding structure looming over the park known as the Birdcage Castle. In an instant, they are knocked unconscious—and when they awaken, they find metal collars around their necks, each connected to another person. The game they unwittingly entered is simple: they cannot turn back from any chosen path, and they must always move in pairs. The punishment for breaking either of these rules is certain death. With their lives on the line, Gin and his classmates must ascend through the bloody castle, battling the mind games thrown at them while searching for Kumo. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Ayase Tsugumi is an orphan of mixed European and Japanese descent, possessing unsettling red eyes and light-colored hair—all these characteristics make him a target for bullying at his school in Japan. When a secretive benefactor under the alias \"Daddy-Long-Legs\" starts sending him letters, teaching him English and offering to send him to a new school in Europe, Tsugumi readily accepts this escape from his present circumstances. When Tsugumi arrives at Zugvogel Academy, he finds it to be a boys' boarding school governed by a strange tradition. There are no formal regulations laid down by the administration; rather, the rules are arbitrarily determined by the school's \"King.\" Anyone wishing for freedom from the rules must repeatedly succeed in the King's \"Game\" and rise through the ranks. However, players must be willing to hurt others or else be hurt themselves. Despite Tsugumi's experiences with bullying, he has never wished to be the tormentor instead of the victim. After unintentionally leveling up on his first day, he looks for a way to remove himself as a player. Unexpectedly, he receives help from the only student to have cleared all the levels in the Game, Licht, who has taken a keen interest in Tsugumi for some unknown reason. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He is his father's youngest child and on top of that, his mistress's child, but he was still appointed as heir. There's danger that people will aim for his life. They attach to him a new maid, with glasses, naturally clumsy and ill-mannered... who turns out to be his new bodyguard, defending Tomoe with her mop! (Source: Aerandria Scans)",
