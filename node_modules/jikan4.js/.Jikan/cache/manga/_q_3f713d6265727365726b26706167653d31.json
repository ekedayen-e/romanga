          "synopsis": "Guts, a former mercenary now known as the \"Black Swordsman,\" is out for revenge. After a tumultuous childhood, he finally finds someone he respects and believes he can trust, only to have everything fall apart when this person takes away everything important to Guts for the purpose of fulfilling his own desires. Now marked for death, Guts becomes condemned to a fate in which he is relentlessly pursued by demonic beings. Setting out on a dreadful quest riddled with misfortune, Guts, armed with a massive sword and monstrous strength, will let nothing stop him, not even death itself, until he is finally able to take the head of the one who stripped him—and his loved one—of their humanity. [Written by MAL Rewrite] Included one-shot: Volume 14: Berserk: The Prototype",

And thus, finally, his constant hunger had been satiated for the first time. With just that, the man who has been treated like a pile of trash slowly started raising his head. Having exceeded the concept of levels, he strikes fear with his terror-like strength, earning him the nickname... (Source: Novel Updates)",

          "synopsis": "When Griffith realizes that he will no longer be able to actualize his dream in his debilitated state, he wishes upon his Crimson Behelit as a final resort. Doing so triggers the \"Eclipse\"—a ritual in which the invoker sacrifices something of significance in exchange for great power. Griffith ultimately chooses to offer his legion of devoted followers, the Band of the Hawk. Subsequently, Griffith transcends to the Abyss where he faces an enormous entity akin to God. The being introduces itself as the Idea of Evil. Coveted into existence by humanity's collective subconsciousness, it has gone on to manipulate the lives of humans throughout all world events. As Griffith now exists as a part of the human consciousness, present in the Abyss, the Idea of Evil eerily declares \"Your desire is my desire... May your actions bring pain or salvation to mankind. Do as you will, Chosen One.\" With that, Griffith harvests the pain of his comrades to transform into his ideal self. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Central to the setting is the Sacred Kingdom of Midgand, which stretches across multiple large islands and smaller archipelagos. It is large enough to have climate variations ranging between its northern and southern regions, with the northern regions recently experiencing stronger snowstorms as the world grows colder. The Kingdom continues to develop its shipbuilding capability, but due to harsh weather, seaborne trade must still travel well-known paths, which are constantly beset by pirates. Three years ago, a sickness known as Daemonblight befell the land. The sickness turns people into Daemons, and the world has fallen into an age of chaos. Even then, in a remote region of the Kingdom, the protagonist Velvet lived with her family in relative comfort. A night came when a red moon rose, and she was betrayed by Artorius, who was once her savior. She lost her family, while a mysterious power that consumed demons possessed her left arm. A measure of order returned to the world after Artorius founded the Abbey and the Exorcists. Artorius is hailed as the world's savior, but Velvet harbored only anger for him. (Source: ANN)",
