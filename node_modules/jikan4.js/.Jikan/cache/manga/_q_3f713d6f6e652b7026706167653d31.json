It's no wonder Masami relies on him so much. He even has four other boyfriends besides Tora, but Tora doesn't seem to mind. He always welcomes Masami with a warm smile and a gentle kiss. But, what if Tora has other guys on the side, too...? Is that why he's so \"understanding\" about Masami's other lovers? (Source: Renta!)",

Chika, the perfect student council president that all the students admire. In that instant, Taiga falls in love with her and begins to work hard to be by her side. But afterwards, he discovers that the perfect president is actually a fake creation of five quintuplet sisters with different personalities and abilities... Does this mean that the girl Taiga fell in love with does not exist? After this discovery, Taiga pretends not to realize that the five people he loves are pretending to be one, and will make them all his girlfriends. (Source: Kadokawa, translated)",

He had somehow managed to sleep through the entire ordeal himself, missing out on the Gift—powers bestowed upon the others by a mysterious Sage who appeared to transport them.

In the public eye, she is a delicate princess, a successful pop star, but in real life, she's a rebellious beauty ostracized by her female schoolmates. She and her classmate, umpa Won (One), seem to have nothing in common on the surface. Eumpa is a quiet boy, ignorant of the pop culture that has enchanted most of his peers. Having spent his childhood as a depressed prodigy in the United States, he has now resolved to lead a normal life as a regular boy. He likes a cute-but-average-looking girl, Young-ju Chae. Young-ju takes him to a pop concert, and Eumpa is exposed to Jenny's music for the first time. Meanwhile, umpa's resolution to live a normal life is challenged when his music teacher steals the young man's music and attempts to pass it off as his own... So begins the story of One...

Ace's departure from Dawn Island marks the beginning of his pirate adventure, and he immediately finds himself deserted on an uninhabited, desolate island. There, he meets a mysterious man, who quickly becomes drawn to Ace's personality and befriends him. Aiming to get themselves off the island, the duo decides to work together to build a boat. However, due to a lack of food on the isle, the pair only have so much time to finish making their craft, causing tension to arise between the two. Nonetheless, the appearance of a special fruit may give them the hope needed to escape the island—because if they succeed, they vow to sail the Grand Line together.
