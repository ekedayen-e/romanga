        "synopsis": "The sun has set on Naruto Uzumaki's youth and is rising on the children of the next generation. One of these kids is Sarada Uchiha, daughter of Naruto's best friends Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Sharing a strong likeness with her father, Sarada has always wondered why she doesn't have any of her mother's features. When she discovers a photograph featuring Sasuke's old comrade Karin, Sarada is shocked to discover that she bears more of a resemblance to this strange woman than she does to her mother. When Sasuke returns to the village with news of a massive impending threat, Naruto obeys his duty as the Seventh Hokage and accompanies his old friend on an investigative mission. Unbeknownst to them both, Sarada and her friend Chouchou Akimichi pursue them, intent on solving the mystery of Sarada's parentage. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
