A being whose blood is said to grant eternal life or wisdom, the radiant figure ensures the continuation of sentient life in the universe as it oversees human civilizations and their development. Yet, mankind remains a slave to its habits; from happiness and sorrow, to wrath and love, a myriad of emotions continue to play an integral part of human life. Simultaneously, time and time again, certain beliefs and agendas persist over the centuries to disturb the fragile equilibrium of the world's preordained nature and principles. It appears that fate, with its dynamic variables, can manifest itself in many ways—and oftentimes exhibits a bizarre sense of humor. [Written by MAL Rewrite] Note: This is an incomplete series due to Tezuka's death.",
          "background": "Hi no Tori was published over the course of 21 years from 1967 to 1988, but was left incomplete due to Tezuka's death in 1989. The first seven chapters were serialized by COM magazine between 1967 to 1971; the remaining chapters were published by Manga Shounen and Yasei Jidai. Hi no Tori was published in English as Phoenix in 11 volumes by VIZ Media under the VIZ Signature imprint from March 12, 2003 to September 18, 2007. Previous to this, it had had a brief run in the educational publication Mangajin, from May to July, 1992 (issues #17 - #19). A live-action film following the Dawn storyline directed by Kon Ichikawa was released on August 12, 1978 in Japan and later on in March 30, 1979 in the United States.",

          "synopsis": "Part of the angelic bureaucracy, Karasu is sent to earth to retrieve a demon living among humans. However, he's surprised to discover that Shirasagi only wants to throw away his heritage and his powers, and live as a human, and a holy human at that. A priest working out of a bar in the city, Shirasagi teaches children and is generally an all-around wonderful person. But Heaven and Hell both want him back and it's going to be quite a battle.

          "synopsis": "Koyama Kei lost his mother when he was still in elementary school and never connected again with his distant, workaholic father. The only real light in his home life is his sister Moe: a bright college student who obviously adores him. But Kei has intimacy issues that even his sister can't pick up on. 15-year-old Kei has never been in love, but he has sex with anyone who shows him interest. While he's in someone else's arms, he can forget the void in his own life. One day in late Spring, Koyama discovers what's missing: a slightly spacey med-student named Fuji. Unfortunately, Fuji is his sister's boyfriend. (Source: DokiDoki/MU)",

Phi, one of the brothel's most sought-after prostitutes, is tasked with getting him up to speed, but not before toying with him a bit.
