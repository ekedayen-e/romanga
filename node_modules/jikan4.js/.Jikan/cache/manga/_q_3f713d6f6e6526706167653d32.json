It's no wonder Masami relies on him so much. He even has four other boyfriends besides Tora, but Tora doesn't seem to mind. He always welcomes Masami with a warm smile and a gentle kiss. But, what if Tora has other guys on the side, too...? Is that why he's so \"understanding\" about Masami's other lovers? (Source: Renta!)",

          "synopsis": "Yorozu is a college student who feels like a total loser. He has no confidence, and he's always either worrying about messing up or agonizing about the things he's already messed up. After going to see his senpai Ken for help, he is thrown into the world of free mahjong parlors, where one plays against total strangers. Yorozu's never played free before, but luckily he has Ken, one of the best players around, to help him learn the ropes. And he's going to need all the help he can get, as the mahjong world is teeming with tough opponents... [Written by Denji] included one-shot: Volume 10: Boku no Kimochi Aitsu no Kimochi",

The two, who are not particularly close to each other, have been childhood friends since they were small and have a bad relationship. It changes when Sakima goes into heat and starts groping himself while sniffing the scent off of Renji's uniform.

Not only was it found by the guy who he didn't want to find it out the most, but he is now also tampered with and disturbed by Sakima's...?! (Source: Kasakura Shuppansha, translated)",
