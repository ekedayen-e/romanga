Nobi is bad at sports, his grades are terrible, he can't even win a match of rock-paper-scissors. Doraemon has a hard task ahead of him but he is well prepared with a huge arsenal of the most inventive and funny gadgets available. The problem is he's not the most competent robot cat helper out there either and the pair gets in constant trouble because of it. Thus begins one of the most interesting friendships ever to appear in a manga series.",

The rules for baseball remain largely unchanged in the 22nd century, with the notable exception that three designated secret gadgets from the main Doraemon series can be used in each game.

All the seven male members are cat-like robots of the same type, enjoy dorayaki, but usually add their own preferred seasoning. They have rock-hard heads they can use as a weapons, or to break out of prison (among other things), but this is even more enhanced in Doraemon, since he has no other special weapons, and has no ears or hat to get in the way when using this mode of attack. The gadget that can connect them is Friendship Telecard. They can call each other with the card everywhere and every time when one or more members are facing problems. (Source: Wikipedia)",

This series have a very major difference with Nobita's frequent participation in most of the Doraemons' adventures, instead of the only focus on the Doraemons. However, other recurring characters from the main series (Shizuka, etc.) and human partners of other DD7 members don't have too much focus as same as Nobita. The adventures mostly appear in many different eras rather than 22nd century, and some of the character settings have slight differences from the original version by Tanaka. (Source: Wikipedia)",

          "synopsis": "Kou is a member of the public morals committee at Moriyaji Gakuen, along with his childhood friend Ai and kouhai Karen. One day while he was making the rounds after school, he was attacked by a weird being. He was frozen in fear and could not evade its attack, but he was saved by two girls, Konoka and Lizera. They were ‘daemon busters’ who fight against daemons borne from the lust and cravings of humans. They told him that he was a kyuumashi who could absorb the desires that create daemons, and they asked for his help since his special ability makes their battles much easier. When he uses his ability, it causes him to be able to see girls naked and also makes them horny. If the daemons aren’t defeated, then their lust will cause the whole school to become an orgy. As part of the public morals committee, he can’t let that happen! (Source: Hau~ Omochikaeri!)",

After fighting to survive for 80 years, he finally defeats the Demon God, and a message pops up asking \"Would You Like to Return to Earth?\" He accepts, and wakes up in a hospital bed, having been in a vegetative state ever since he fell into hell. Only 10 years had passed on Earth, and during that time, wormholes called Gates teeming with monsters from another dimension began appearing, which are dealt with by professionals known as Hunters. Daesung struggles with the harsh reality of losing all the power he'd gained in those 80 years, when suddenly a quest pop-up from hell appears.",

The summaries below are taken from DK Sanctuary Title Story: One Day, Another Day Summary: Set before the end of the series, it's basically a side story of a day in the Dragon Castle, kind of in Zoma's perspective. Title: Juuji ni Hikaru Hoshi Summary: Takes place before the events of the actual series. This is a back story that shows how Lykouleon and Raselane met, introducing Lykouleon's uncle, Fieruto. Title: Mamono no Mori no Kioku Summary: Another backstory that delves a little bit more into the relationship between Bierrez and Cesia before the series started. It also shows how Nadil became the demon lord. Title: Happiest Children Summary: This actually has three little side stories in it. The first one is about Rune's dream about everyone dressed in drag, the second is about a little adventure that the three dragons go on, and then the third is like a day in the life of Alfeegi, Ri-ma, and Duma. Title: Crescendo Summary: Backstory about how Lykouleon and Kaistern met and how Kaistern then became the Blue Dragon Officer. Title: CONFESSION - Thats Summary: This is basically the backstory of Thatz and how he knew about Rath's little secret. Title: CONFESSION - Rath Summary: The final gaiden published by Ohkami through WINGS. Basically telling a lot about Rath, particularly his relationship with Kaistern.",
