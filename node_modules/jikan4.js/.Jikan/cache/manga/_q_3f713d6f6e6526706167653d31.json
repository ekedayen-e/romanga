          "synopsis": "High schooler Jenny You is living a dream. In the public eye, she is a delicate princess, a successful pop star, but in real life, she's a rebellious beauty ostracized by her female schoolmates. She and her classmate, umpa Won (One), seem to have nothing in common on the surface. Eumpa is a quiet boy, ignorant of the pop culture that has enchanted most of his peers. Having spent his childhood as a depressed prodigy in the United States, he has now resolved to lead a normal life as a regular boy. He likes a cute-but-average-looking girl, Young-ju Chae. Young-ju takes him to a pop concert, and Eumpa is exposed to Jenny's music for the first time. Meanwhile, umpa's resolution to live a normal life is challenged when his music teacher steals the young man's music and attempts to pass it off as his own... So begins the story of One...

Ace's departure from Dawn Island marks the beginning of his pirate adventure, and he immediately finds himself deserted on an uninhabited, desolate island. There, he meets a mysterious man, who quickly becomes drawn to Ace's personality and befriends him. Aiming to get themselves off the island, the duo decides to work together to build a boat. However, due to a lack of food on the isle, the pair only have so much time to finish making their craft, causing tension to arise between the two. Nonetheless, the appearance of a special fruit may give them the hope needed to escape the island—because if they succeed, they vow to sail the Grand Line together.

But just before his demise, he confirms the existence of a great treasure, One Piece, located somewhere within the vast ocean known as the Grand Line. Announcing that One Piece can be claimed by anyone worthy enough to reach it, the King of the Pirates is executed and the Great Age of Pirates begins. Twenty-two years later, a young man by the name of Monkey D. Luffy is ready to embark on his own adventure, searching for One Piece and striving to become the new King of the Pirates. Armed with just a straw hat, a small boat, and an elastic body, he sets out on a fantastic journey to gather his own crew and a worthy ship that will take them across the Grand Line to claim the greatest status on the high seas.

The anime adapted the five initial chapters in the recap episodes 279–283. The Straw Hat Theater concept was created when Oda was given three blank sheets of paper by his editor and told to draw anything. (Source: One Piece Wiki)",

Visiting Okinawa, Tokuchi's hometown, is Hiromichi Kojima, the star batter of the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons, the weakest team in the Japanese baseball league. Dreaming of leading the Lycaons to winning the championship, and in dire need of a replacement for their injured pitcher during a training camp, Kojima involves himself in a game of One Outs, only to lose to a normal fastball from the seemingly invincible Tokuchi. Mesmerized by his prowess, Kojima recruits Tokuchi to the team after narrowly avoiding defeat in a rematch, believing he might just be their key to victory. However, the greedy owner of the Lycaons refuses to give him a decent salary, leading Tokuchi to suggest an unusual contract: every out he pitches will gain him five million yen, but every run he gives up will lose him fifty million yen. With his fate now tied to that of the team, Tokuchi's fight to bring the Lycaons to victory becomes yet another gamble—the very thing that he does best. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Inside the jungles of Vietnam, a courageous Special Ops. Unit is fighting the most infamous war of decades past—the Vietnam War. This bold account follows the brave exploits of Sergeant \"Perky\" Perkins and his unit...of rabbits! Join Rats, Perky and Botaski as they fight against the cats of the Viet Cong. From the Tet Offensive to the My Canh bombing, watch these commando-style bunnies through an anthropomorphic lens as events unfold and violence erupts. On-human cast of characters notwithstanding, this compelling and painstakingly-researched work places an emphasis on factualism in order to accurately portray the events of the Vietnam War. With a fresh perspective on one of history's greatest calamities, Apocalypse Meow is a daring new take on a conflict that won't soon be forgotten...especially after these young rabbits are done!

The two discuss their situation, including the history of Fuuka's roommates—most of whom were male. Feeling the need to let her know up front, Fuuka comes out to Miho as a lesbian. With the sexuality of her roommate not an issue to the open-hearted Miho, she promptly moves in. Flirty jokes directed at her from Fuuka and her attractive female friends become commonplace. But as feelings change and the jokes become more serious, Miho is put in a dilemma. When Fuuka romantically closes in, why does Miho feel so happy? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
