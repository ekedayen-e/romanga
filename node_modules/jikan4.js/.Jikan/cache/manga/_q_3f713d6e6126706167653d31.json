After a traumatic event she experienced as a teenager, Juri has attempted suicide three times and has come to hate her mother. With her life clouded due to a dark past, her aunt Monica, a member of the clergy, invites her to visit a convict sentenced to death. Yuu is a death row inmate charged with murdering three people, leading to many attempts at ending his own life within his jail cell. He frequently receives letters from Monica, who hopes to help him, but sees this as an act of pity.

She is the exact opposite of Yamato Kurosawa—the most popular boy at school. Having dated several girls in their year already, Yamato is a flirt who gets along with everyone he meets. Mei's aloof demeanor immediately catches Yamato's attention, who vows to become her friend no matter what. After a tense situation where Yamato protects her from a stalker at night, Mei believes that she is developing feelings for him. Soon enough, the two teens find themselves in an unlikely relationship together, much to the dismay of Mei and her jealous classmates. As they grow closer, Mei will need to determine whether or not her affection is genuine and if she has the courage to say \"I love you.\" [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Having his kindness backfire on him, he ends up at the notorious \"Sakura Hall,\" where he meets its residents—a cast of eccentric, artistic prodigies. Stuck with an increasing number of stray cats in addition to being average amongst geniuses, Sorata is determined to find new owners for these cats and leave Sakura Hall for good. Shortly after moving in, his life is further thrown into disarray as he is tasked with taking care of Mashiro Shiina, a new transfer student and aspiring manga author. Despite being a world-renowned artist, she lacks common sense and is utterly incapable of looking out for herself. With the support of their fellow Sakura Hall residents, Sorata and Mashiro grow ever closer as they weave through the webs of expectations and determine their self-worth, striving to discover their true calling in life.

Although he doesn't mind his roommates, Sorata can't wait to move out of Sakura Halls. But when Shiina Mashiro moves into the dorm, everything changes. Mashiro is an artistic genius who, at a young age, won many awards for her skills, but due to her childhood being so focused on art, she has no common sense and social skills. Forced to take the role of taking care of Mashiro, Sorata learns about himself and begins on a path of self improvement. (Source: MangaHelpers)",

However, those who possess the \"traits\" of a \"warrior\" or \"wizard\" are but a few. Most will become no more than mere \"villagers.\" I, Satou, am also one of those \"villagers\"; but one day, a girl possessing the trait of \"demon lord,\" Ryuugamine Ouko, set her eyes on me. She's short and a surprisingly calm, good girl, but she'll abruptly mutter about destroying mankind; give me a break. Taking up the opposition with passion is my childhood friend, Hikarigaoka Tsubasa; she's more trouble. This girl is also quite the beauty, but as soon as she makes up her mind, she's an absolute troublemaker... This is a world that's slightly abnormal, with a slightly abnormal cast, interwoven in their dilemmas; a slapstick comedy!",

Though they did care for him, he could tell he was a burden and happily prepared to move to a high school with a dormitory. Unfortunately, the dormitory burned down before he could move in! Yuushi doesn't want to live with his relatives anymore, but it's rough finding lodging as an orphaned student with little money. He finally finds a room in a nice old building which seems too good to be true. The catch is that it is a Monster House, a place where humans and supernatural creatures—ghosts, mononoke, etc.—live together. Another high schooler lives there, a cute girl named Akine, and she's completely unfazed by the monsters. In fact, she can even exorcise evil spirits! Yuushi's high school life just got much stranger than he ever bargained for! (Source: MangaHelpers)",

          "synopsis": "It was decided that Nishi High School would close in two years time and since then, the student population had dramatically dropped down to a total of seven. The remaining students, including Hazakura Motoya, decided to stay for the free ride through high school. So everyone is shocked when they suddenly receive three new transfer students, all girls: Kayama, Mizumura and Toujou. But their appearance is just a cover; they are elite members of a special military division that reports only to the president. Soon after, Motoya witnesses a giant tower suddenly appearing on the school grounds. According to his new classmates, the tower can only be seen by a handful of chosen people and that all the military technology that the country has been able to develop in recent years was based on the information gathered from inside the mysterious tower. Motoya has been chosen by destiny to enter the tower with Kayama, Mizumura and Toujou to uncover the mysteries of the tower. (Source: MangaHelpers)",

Welcome to the University of Love (Ai no University e Youkoso) One day at a college campus in Japan, Riku was waking up from a nap during lunchtime. Problem is? He likes to sleep on the rooftop. After waking up that day, to him it seemed like it would be just a normal schoolday. However, due to dreariness, as he begins to climb down the nearby tree to head to class, he loses his balance and slips. However, the handsome foreign transfer student, Kairi Lawrence, who also happens to be the son of a billionaire, catches him as he falls. And afterwards they become friends. But because of the constant looming presence of Kairi's bodyguards, and the isolation of his fellow classmates, Riku feels like he's not living the normal campus life he wants to.

          "synopsis": "After her father abandons their family and her mother dies, Miyuki Yagyuu is left solely in charge of her family's affairs, inheriting both riches and her father's business. Her relatives often quarrel over the distribution of wealth among the family, and as a result, Miyuki feels burdened by being her father's successor. She seeks comfort from her personal butler, Mikage, a young and handsome man who was adopted as a child to serve her. One evening, Miyuki dreams about being intimate with Mikage; however, the man in her dream shows a side of him previously unbeknownst to her. As the dreams continue to flood her mind days later, she begins to question the truth of them. Are the people she sees in her dreams the real Miyuki and Mikage, or are they only figments of her imagination? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
