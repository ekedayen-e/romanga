          "synopsis": "Mercenary Cloud Strife and his allies have prevented an apocalyptic attack from the psychotic Sephiroth, but human civilization remains in tatters. Furthermore, each member of Avalanche, the victorious rebel group, struggles with a growing emptiness and a lack of purpose in their new reality. Cloud's childhood friend Tifa Lockhart, who feels responsible for the loss of innocent lives, desperately tries to sustain her relationship with him. Still, the burden of their dead companions leads to a growing rift between them. Meanwhile, Barret Wallace and Red XIII search for a new ambition now that the threat of Sephiroth has passed, and Yuffie Kisaragi returns to her home nation of Wutai to help its citizens combat a new disease known as Geostigma. But somewhere in the lifestream—the collective spiritual energy of the world and all who have died on its surface—lurks the remnants of Sephiroth's vengeful spirit, left to stew in its hatred toward Cloud and the rest of the human race. And while the soul of someone dear to Cloud monitors Sephiroth's growing animosity, the villain's revenge plot continues to spiral closer to completion. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Why? Because he has superb photographic memory called “Shutter Eye” (Shutter as in the shutter of a camera). He meets Niko Kurihara, the female protagonist, who dislikes men, is a master of martial arts, and is of course beautiful. Utsuru attempts to prove to Niko that he is not the guy she thinks he so he can take a picture of her. (Source: MangaHelpers)",

          "synopsis": "After stealing a wallet on a train ride, pickpocket Jimmy believes that he has slipped away scot-free. However, upon meeting the gaze of Reese Heyman, he realizes that he has been caught red-handed. Yet rather than hand him over to the police, Reese only makes Jimmy work with him at the bookstore for a day. Despite the lenient punishment, Jimmy feels humiliated and enraged. Seeking revenge, he attempts to loot Reese's apartment; but instead, he discovers that the man is a former police officer! Terrified of what might happen, Jimmy abandons the raid and returns to his own life. Still wary of retribution for his attempted burglary, Jimmy overhears some cops gossiping about Reese's retirement. Intrigued by the retired cop's convoluted past, Jimmy pretends to have turned over a new leaf and asks Reese if he can continue working part-time at the bookstore. As they carry out their duties, Jimmy finds himself growing more fond of his co-worker—and as his feelings morph into love, their relationship slowly flourishes.

          "synopsis": "Yuuri Mito is a typical, normal Japanese teenager. He goes to school, works on people's motorcycles and performs exorcisms. Okay, that last part's a little bit unusual, but his family lives in a shrine and they do that sort of thing. Still, you would think he'd know enough to be careful with an ancient relic he finds in the woods, especially when a mysterious goddess appears and tells him to leave it alone. Unfortunately, despite Mito's best efforts, the seal gets broken anyway and a number of dangerous \"tayuti\" that it held in stasis get loose. This is bad. Mito also ends up with a beautiful goddess girl who decides that she's going to marry him. This might not be so bad. if he wasn't already caught up in the middle of a war between the entities he's released. The flesh may be weak but the spirit's more than willing to compensate.

          "synopsis": "I met an adventurer in Final Fantasy XIV after my cousin had pushed me to start playing. She was a adorable cat girl with a sweet and charming personality. But outside the game she was a girl with dark, sunken eyes playing from her laptop on a care facility bed. As her scars cast a shadow in the game world, we began feeling a connection in the real world. I knew the smiles she showed me in the game weren't fake. So I started trying to support her in her grey hospital room, just like she had supported me in Eorzea. (Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
