          "synopsis": "The beautiful Goddess Altea, creator of the tranquil worlds of Lagendia, plummeted into unconsciousness after being poisoned by her jealous, evil sister Vestinel. The poison can only be neutralized by an antidote made from the source of the poison itself—Vestinel's magic grail—which has disappeared into Lagendia along with sinister Vestinel herself. Able to communicate to her people only through dreams, the Goddess Altea calls upon the Heroes of Lagendia, via all-knowing prophets, to find the grail and save her from her eternal slumber. In their quest, the bold warriors must comb the lands for enchanted Power Stones, which allow them to speak with the prophets and unlock the will of Altea through her dreams. But the hunt for the Power Stones is not for the meek, as since the Goddess Altea's poisoning, the formerly peaceful lands of Lagendia have become home to throngs of deadly dragons bent on thwarting the grail's discovery and keeping the land in despair.",

          "synopsis": "The time is Sengoku in feudal Japan, in the land of Tosa. The Chousokabe family lives in Castle Okou with Kunichika as the head of the clan. He plans on invading neighboring states to control more land and bring prosperity to the people. However, the son, Motochika, disagrees with his father's course of action and refuses to take part in the warfare. The angered Kunichika throws his son into a river and disowns him. Motochika struggles to stay afloat and eventually loses consciousness but washes up on land alive. Confused as to why he washed up on the beach and there is no Castle Okou in sight, he asks the people and learns he is hundreds of years in the future and the Chousokabe family has not been heard of in years. Still not wanting to believe the reality of the situation, he wanders the land trying to make sense of the matter. Through a turn of events, he meets Sakamoto Ryouma, the famous revolutionist of the 1860's. Will Motochika help Ryouma overthrow the feudal empire, the same government he grew up in? What destiny holds for these two characters from different centuries that never even should have met in the first place?",

However, her stale life changes one morning when she is greeted at her front door by the huge face of a dragon. Introducing herself as Tooru, the dragon transforms into a young woman in a maid outfit. Having met Kobayashi drunk in the mountains the night before, she accepts Kobayashi's invitation to live with her as her personal housemaid. Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon follows the daily life of Kobayashi, her dragon maid Tooru, and various other dragons as they move past their differences to grow closer together.

          "synopsis": "After watching the man who holds her affections walk down the aisle with another woman, Wendy Blanchett bids farewell to the love she had locked deep within her heart. One drunken mistake later, she wakes up naked in bed with Aiden Winters, the newest trainee at the Tower of Magic. As his superior, Wendy is aghast at what she has done, offering to make it up to Aiden in any way possible. She is certain that he will only ask for money or a promotion—but against all expectations, Aiden demands that Wendy take responsibility for her actions by marrying him! Thus begins the tenuous relationship between a witch and her subordinate; however, unbeknownst to Wendy, Aiden is hiding a secret about his shockingly primeval nature. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She is currently living away from home as a boarding student with her pet named Lime. Her father is a sorcerer and her mother is an expert in Chinese kenpo. They are both famous, especially her mother who is called Dragon Momoka. Because of her mother's fame the executive committee wants Anjuu to join the student council. But the council's president thinks that she is a weak girl, so to prove him wrong she decides to catch the school thief. But when things get harder, she wishes to become stronger. So her pet suddenly transforms into a small child with wings (it can't transform into a dragon yet, because it's only a child) and tells her about her power. During a second assault from the thief, Anjuu, with the help of Lime, transforms into a new Saint Dragon Girl, defeating the enemies and becoming the school's protector. Will the student council's members find out the true identity of the \"warrior\" girl? Will Anjuu be able to keep her secret? (Source: StarryHeaven)",

The infant is barely old enough to say her own name, but is quite confident in calling the dragon \"Daddy\"! Bewildered by the unexpected visitor, the dragon soon learns that returning her to human civilization isn't going to be an option...not yet, anyway. He quickly decides to raise the girl himself, determined to give her a happy life that will lead her back to human society when she is older—surely a simple task for a legendary being such as himself. All he needs to do now is find a place for her to sleep. And figure out where he is going to get clothes for her. And...wait, what do humans eat again? (Source: J-Novel Club)",

Powerful enough to have been venerated by humankind, yet warmhearted and even a tad ditzy, the dragon soon finds himself raising and doting on the precocious Olivia as if she really were his daughter in this touching tale. The toddler may be impossibly cute now, but just you wait—she's a curious child and she's growing up real fast. You can bet that one day, she'll be the strongest human there is! But first, how will he handle little Olivia receiving an acceptance letter to a human school? (Source: J-Novel Club)",

He's the legendary attorney Sakuragi Kenji, who will waltz back to the fallen Ryuzan High School where the students' academic aptitude is plummeting.

Part 2 of Dragon Zakura, the legendary \"manga that will help you pass the University of Tokyo entrance exams\" — which helped change the landscape of Japan's university entrance exams — is here at last!

You get to see the developers as real people, who agonize over everything, like how big to make the text boxes, what should NPCs say, etc, as well as how they get along with each other.
