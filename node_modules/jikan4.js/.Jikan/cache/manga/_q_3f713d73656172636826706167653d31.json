          "synopsis": "Najika Kazami is passionate about food and the connections people can make by sharing their favorite dishes. She possesses an absolute sense of taste and can easily discern the ingredients and method of preparation of anything she eats. Anju Takanashi, a classmate of Najika, comes to her and asks if she can recreate a certain dessert her grandmother once enjoyed. With nothing more than a \"fluffy and heavenly\" taste and a connection to her deceased parents to help her achieve her goal, Najika wonders if she will ever figure out what the mysterious confection is.

          "synopsis": "Five powerful death row inmates break free from their respective prisons in America, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Russia. Each convict flees to Tokyo to achieve his one goal: to suffer defeat at the hands of the world's strongest fighters. Seventeen-year-old fighting champion Baki Hanma continues to train his body beyond its limits in order to one day challenge his monstrous father, Yuujirou Hanma, to a battle. Baki grows bored with his obligatory high school studies but finds comfort and strength in his budding relationship with Kozue Matsumoto. The quiet stasis of his life is disrupted by the arrival of the death row convicts as each criminal proves his might in displays of lethal force across Tokyo. To combat this growing threat, Baki bands together with yakuza Kaoru Hanayama, rival Retsu Kaiou, mentor Doppo Orochi, and elderly jujitsu master Gouki Shibukawa. Together the five warriors agree to seek out and defeat their criminal opponents. But Baki faces the added burden of protecting Kozue from his evil new enemies, and he must fight to prove himself worthy under the watchful eye of his father, Yuujirou. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "A girl named Haruka Mikami confronts her friend Asuka Morisaki, asking her to search for her body. Bewildered, Asuka tells her friends about it, only to discover that Haruka had also asked the same of them. Unable to understand why they would be asked to do such a thing, they assume it is just a prank. But after some strange incidents, they are mysteriously transported to their school at the stroke of midnight. Realizing that they must find the eight pieces of Haruka's body in order to leave, they begin their search in the school's darkened corridors. Asuka and the others have much more to worry about than simply finding their friend's dismembered corpse, however—a blood-covered girl stalks the hallways and will kill the students if she catches them. If the increasingly desperate group can't find Haruka's body, they will have to repeat the nightmarish event over and over again until their grim task is completed. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Sara, a royal maid in the Kingdom of Saleilles, is ordered by the king to enter a political marriage with the eldest prince of their rival kingdom, Ferrier—but as the body-double of the real princess! But then Sara's boyfriend cheats on her with the princess she considered a friend and turns on Sara completely! Utterly betrayed by those she trusted most, Sara hits rock bottom, heart shattered... Farewell, Princess I used to love and respect. Farewell, my once-beloved boyfriend. So Sara makes a decision—she will find happiness in Ferrier no matter what! But that all hinges on her husband-to-be...a reclusive, misanthropic prince who has a slightly difficult personality and is constantly wearing a mask. To make matters worse, rumors are spreading in Ferrier of a terrifying black beast on the prowl... Can Sara ever hope to find happiness in these conditions?! (Source: Cross Infinite World)",

Though this rare cancer can be cured by removing her vocal cords, Mitsuki refuses because of her desire to become a pop singer and keep her childhood promise to Eichi Sakurai, her first love who left for America. Unable to both heal and keep her voice, she allows her health to deteriorate as she accepts her tragic fate. One day, while escaping the home of her music-hating grandmother to attend an audition, Mitsuki meets two shinigami Takuto Kira and Meroko Yui. Realizing that Mitsuki can see them, Takuto and Meroko reveal to her that she will die in a year. Moved by her plight, Takuto allows Mitsuki the chance to pursue her dream by giving her the ability to transform into a healthy sixteen-year-old girl. After being chosen for a contract with Seed Records, Mitsuki makes her debut under the stage name Full Moon and chooses to pursue her dream music career before her life's end.
