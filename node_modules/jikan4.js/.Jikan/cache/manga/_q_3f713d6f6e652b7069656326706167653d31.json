          "synopsis": "Gol D. Roger, a man referred to as the \"King of the Pirates,\" is set to be executed by the World Government. But just before his demise, he confirms the existence of a great treasure, One Piece, located somewhere within the vast ocean known as the Grand Line. Announcing that One Piece can be claimed by anyone worthy enough to reach it, the King of the Pirates is executed and the Great Age of Pirates begins. Twenty-two years later, a young man by the name of Monkey D. Luffy is ready to embark on his own adventure, searching for One Piece and striving to become the new King of the Pirates. Armed with just a straw hat, a small boat, and an elastic body, he sets out on a fantastic journey to gather his own crew and a worthy ship that will take them across the Grand Line to claim the greatest status on the high seas. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "The infamous Portgas D. Ace's departure from Dawn Island marks the beginning of his pirate adventure, and he immediately finds himself deserted on an uninhabited, desolate island. There, he meets a mysterious man, who quickly becomes drawn to Ace's personality and befriends him. Aiming to get themselves off the island, the duo decides to work together to build a boat. However, due to a lack of food on the isle, the pair only have so much time to finish making their craft, causing tension to arise between the two. Nonetheless, the appearance of a special fruit may give them the hope needed to escape the island—because if they succeed, they vow to sail the Grand Line together.

          "synopsis": "A series of 3-page long One Piece omake manga strips drawn by Eiichiro Oda. Their stories tend to parody other genres such as science fiction or fairy tales. Most of them were initially published as bonus content in One Piece Complete Collection between the 2nd Log (2005) and the 20th Log (2012). The anime adapted the five initial chapters in the recap episodes 279–283. The Straw Hat Theater concept was created when Oda was given three blank sheets of paper by his editor and told to draw anything. (Source: One Piece Wiki)",

His momentary stasis is broken by the arrival of a food critic with gourmet tastes—a woman who is completely unimpressed with the food she's served by Baratie's staff. With Baratie's head chef Zeff away on business, Sanji must deliver a meal capable of silencing the complaining critic before she can depart with a bad taste in her mouth. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
