Despite being surrounded by stardom his whole life, a traumatizing experience at a commercial shoot 10 years ago forced him into emotional recluse and eventually into the arms of his favorite fictional character, Magical Girl LalaLulu. However, it turns out that Izumi is not in the clear yet. Considering that he is far from becoming a manga artist of any sort, he joins a shooting for the sequel of that dreaded commercial from his past. What's more, his co-star from the past, who is also invited to reprise his role, is none other than the famous actor Ryouma Ichijou. Izumi does not fancy wearing a dress again—but Ryouma is eager to see the beautiful \"girl\" who captured his heart 10 years ago. How will this fateful reunion turn out? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But that is just the beginning of Rintaro's story, as he finds himself unexpectedly in Hell where he meets his guide, the painfully sexy devil Koyori.

Despite his notorious marksmanship, he is a hopeless romantic with no relationship experience! He is also a chronic overthinker, relying on the cliched and often impractical advice of his father, caring more about impressing women than actually catching criminals. But usually, he ends up boosting his reputation as a gunslinger and falling flat with the ladies. Evans is joined by his loyal but naive deputy Ted Hall and bounty hunter, love interest Phoebe Oakley who similarly lacks any relationship experience and tends to overthink things. Together they thwart hijinks and capture infamous criminals, always involving hilarious misunderstandings. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "At the end of the Showa era, the Media Betterment Act was enacted, beginning a country-wide hunt for all media that were deemed offensive. Witnessing the senseless censorship, libraries stood up against this law; the Library Defense Force (LDF) became the only entity capable of fighting off the Media Betterment Committee (MBC). Tomboyish and avid reader Iku Kasahara is the newest member accepted into the Kanto branch of the LDF. Her love of reading has inspired her to join the force in more ways than one: she almost landed in trouble with the MBC five years prior when an unknown LDF agent came to her aid. Iku has since vowed to protect books just like that agent did, and—at just 22 years old—she has now become a promising talent among the new recruits. Although Iku has achieved her dream of joining the LDF, she clashes with her superior Atsushi Doujou, a straight-laced instructor who seems to be particularly hard on her. For that reason, Iku is surprised to find out Doujou, among others, recommends her to be part of the Library Task Forces (LTF). Now part of an exclusive team, Iku must show her value as a member of LTF while executing her duties diligently. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But one day a ghost named Aiya appears and declares that he has been tasked with the mission to change Kanji's life. At this rate, the Yarahata name will not live on so Aiya will become a love doctor and coach him on how to develop relationships with girls. The first hurdle comes when he starts a part time job at a convenience store and sees that his co-worker is a hot girl named Yoshizato Saki who also happens to be the store owner's daughter. With the help of Aiya, Kanji, although stumbling along the way, has a conversation with her and builds a relationship. But he has miles to go if he wants to be the kind of person that can date beautiful women. (Source: MangaHelpers)",
