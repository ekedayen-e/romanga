I found myself in a remote village in the countryside, Thrall Village. From being taken in by the village chief as his adopted daughter, to learning about the country and its language, my leisurely life there had begun. In this manner, six years quietly flew by. But one day, I was suddenly summoned to the royal capital to become a priest's secretary?! Moreover, I received an important task—to find a bride for the Archbishop! (Source: Kadokawa, translated)",
