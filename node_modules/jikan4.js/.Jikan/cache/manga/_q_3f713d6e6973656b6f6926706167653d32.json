Soon, Takafumi discovers two bizarre things: His uncle treasures video games above all else, and, while comatose, he was actually transported to another world as some heroic guardian! Now, not only does Takafumi have to room with an uncle who is literally magical, he also has to catch the guy up on two decades of history—smartphones, high-speed internet, modern anime tropes...and the traumatic outcome of the '90s console war!

Luckily, Kousuke also has the power to craft using a special video game menu that allows him to harvest resources and build whatever he can imagine. However, every time he goes to sleep, he’s attacked by one of the many non-human races of this world, all of whom despise humankind. Enter Sylphy, the beautiful dark elf who lays claim to Kousuke and vows to protect him–after all, she’s taken him as her property! (Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

          "synopsis": "Our protagonist is a college student who enjoys playing as the evil-aligned faction Arachnea in her favorite real-time strategy game. One day, she finds herself in a world similar to the one in the game; additionally, her body is now that of a fourteen-year-old girl. While things are a bit different from how they were in the game, one element has remained the same: she is the leader of the Arachnea. The insects under her control, collectively known as the Swarm, praise her and implore her to lead them to victory. In order to survive, she raises her Swarm and forms friendly relations with the elves of the neighboring forest. But after a slaver traveling through the forest murders one of her Swarm and the nearby kingdom's knights burn down the elven village and massacre its people, she prepares to launch her counterattacks in the name of revenge. However, revenge is merely a pretense for attacking the countries of this world. Her command is masterful and severe, as one who has played the game in real life... (Source: J-Novel Club)",

As an evil-aligned faction, they sought nothing but victory; the more they conquered, the more they grew, using the bodies of their enemies as fuel to multiply and expand the ever-growing swarm. When she awakens, she is in a body younger than her former one and finds herself surrounded by the Arachnea, who call her \"Her Majesty.\" She soon realizes that she too is connected to the hivemind, and her precious Arachnea still wish for victory—over who and for what ends, that is unclear, but their lust to win is undeniable. To fulfill their desires, she leads the Arachnea, destroying all who are vile in the world. From the religious zealots who murder those unlike them, to the immoral slavers who deal in the lives of others, none are free from her path of carnage. You can plead, weep, or beg, but she has no mercy—the swarm of the Arachnea lives only for victory and to serve Her Majesty. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A small monarchy that has managed to defy all odds against attempts to overcome them during war. Liberl is split into five regions: Rolent, Bose, Ruan, Zeiss, and Grancel. In the city of Rolent, Cassius Bright has raised two children by himself, Estelle and Joshua. He taught them everything they know himself, and encourages them to sign up to become apprentices in the Bracers Guild. Soon after, however, he receives a letter and has to leave on business, leaving Estelle and Joshua to fend for themselves. While working, they receive notice one day that their father's airship has gone missing. With this in mind, the two gear themselves up, and set off to find the ship and save their father.
