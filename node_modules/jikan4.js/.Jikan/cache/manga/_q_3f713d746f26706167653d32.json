          "synopsis": "For centuries the Lee and Dai had shared a deep bond in the form of a master-servant relationship which gradually evolved into a strong friendship between the heirs of both families. Therefore true to tradition Dai Xiaodao (aka Dai Xiaoshuang) decides to assume the role of the manservant for Li Qingri (aka childhood friend) in place of her dead brother, Dai Dadao. To her chagrin, pretending to be a boy was but the tip of the iceberg in terms of the list of challenges that would come her way. On top of having to contain her secret love for Li Qingri who has become her roommate... what's the deal with that sinister-looking senpai (who's always flashing some fish at her) and that sweet-looking female classmate (who's really a carnivore in herbivore's clothing)! All that aside, what was that mysteriously beautiful scent that Dai Xiaodao got a whiff of when she bumped into the notorious Ye Weien at that secret path? Surely, no matter what the legend says, that obnoxious playboy could not be the man of her destiny! (Source: Anibebe)",

          "synopsis": "Whirlpool’s 5th title is about the bonds between humans and spirits. Akihito lives in Mishiro-machi, a town which is said to be protected by a local god and spirits, but not many people nowadays believe this. Every 10 years, there is a large festival at the local shrine. Akihito serves as the priest during the festival due to his lineage, while his childhood friend Nazuna is chosen as the miko. There are rumours of a strange being around town and he doesn’t believe them until he saw the spirit himself. It seems that the spirit was lost and they help it return deep into a forest where normal people cannot enter. There he meets the beautiful god of the land Suzu. He decides to protect all the spirits in the town and return them to the forest. (Source: Hau~ Omochikaeri!)",

          "synopsis": "Hiding in the school toilet, Daichi Shinagawa curses upon the fact that his idle high school life is suddenly interrupted by an annoying presence—the class representative Hana Adachi. Unfortunately for the delinquent, the eccentric Adachi enters the male washroom without hesitation and discovers his hiding spot in a flash. Going on a field trip with his classmates is the least of Shinagawa's concerns, but that is the very thing that Adachi would not give up on. By hook or crook, she insists that everyone in the class attend the trip, including the reluctant Shinagawa. To make matters worse, despite his constant rejection Adachi would keep following Shinagawa even after school has ended. However, after an encounter with a pair of purse snatchers, Shinagawa soon learns that Adachi has an unexpected side to her, and is soon thrust into chaotic school life filled with her inescapable antics.

In that world, Red, the elder brother of that young girl hero, possessing the Divine Protection of \"The Guide\" which only grants a high initial level, fought in the initial party of the hero. However, with a Divine Protection that only grants a high level but no magic nor martial art nor supernatural ability, he gradually could no longer keep up with the battle and in the end, a companion, a sage, remarked \"You are not a true companion\" as he snatched all his equipment and kicked him out of the party with just a single copper sword. Having his heart completely shattered, Red distanced himself from the battle against the demon lord's army despite knowing that the fate of the world rests on it, aiming to live an inconspicuous life alone at the frontier Zoltan as he earns money to open a herbalist shop by utilizing the knowledge he acquired throughout his journey. Together with the half-elf carpenter living downtown and the princess who couldn't become the hero's companion, he aims to live a slow life in the frontier of the world governed by a person's inborn Divine Protection!

Her parents nag her about finding a suitor but she is neither interested in nor understands love. In an attempt to stop her parents from controlling her life any more than they do, she marries her best friend Hana Agaya, who lost her job and needed a place to crash. Hana is into girls, and she's had a crush on Machi since high school. Machi though, has never experienced the tender feeling of loving or being loved, while Hana is charismatic and outgoing, always doing what she loves and having fun. As the short manga comes to a swift end, only time will tell if their fake marriage will allow true love to flourish or end up driving them apart.
