          "synopsis": "The story settings takes place on Earth, where alien attacks have turned into everyday sights instead of mere rare phenomenon. All countries around the world have united their efforts to develop effective counter measures against the aliens' attack, but all without success. In Japan, there is a secret organization called GRA (GRAND REFLECT AMUDO) under Alien Defense Agency direct control. The main purpose of this organization is to find a special counter measure against alien attack, with help from Dr. Sanada Mio. Dr. Sanada Mio invented a next-generation weapon called \"G-on\" to repel the aliens' attack. This new secret weapon needs to resonate with the heart of its user (has to be a young girl! You know the Japanese anime/manga common approach for transformation bigrazz), and it will turn into a sword which holds power proportional to the strength of the heart of the girl who uses it. Needless to say, the new weapon and the plan are approved immediately, and a special school is established to recruit and train young girls from across the country. (Source: Dynasty)",

          "synopsis": "Baroness Cassia Ruberno has spent a decade in the selfless service of her family within the barren territory of Greze. Meanwhile, her cold husband Zester Greze is constantly away on the battlefield, accepting any job for meager compensation. Ailing and bedridden, Cassia takes her final breath at the age of 28, pitifully regretting all the times she remained quiet and swallowed her misery. But instead of passing on, Cassia miraculously awakens on the day after her wedding a decade ago. As her regret turns into anger, she vows to always speak her mind and fully enjoy life this time around. Surprisingly, her new attitude leads her previously neglectful husband to step up and even reveal an adorable side that she never thought existed. However, she is painfully aware of the war-torn future ahead of them, and so, to secure the safety of Greze, Cassia cannot help but involve herself in business and politics before illness takes her forever.

She’s such a tomboy that all boys are scared of her, and that’s exactly what her brother wanted and trained her to be. It took him six long years to train her into a pseudo-military style girl to protect her from anyone else. Bishonen Sung-Suh is a new transfer student who’s got the looks, the determination, and attitude to sweep her off the feet. Could this male beauty be able to tame the beast? Will Miha’s brother let them be together and happily ever after? If you want it you’ve got to Bring It On! (Source: Yen Press)",

But when the man she sacrificed it all for crowns her cousin as empress instead of her, she loses the will to live. It's only when she's finally succumbed to a lethal dose of poison that she's met with the tears of a heartbroken Prince Faylon, and she realizes her love was wasted on the wrong person. Vowing to exact revenge if ever given the chance, Kaira is thrust back in time to right the wrongs committed against her and reclaim the title that is rightfully hers. As she joins hands with Prince Faylon and sets out to punish those who conspired against her, she'll discover a world she once took for granted and seek to correct the course of her fate.

She's always had a burning passion for acting, but the road to stardom has been anything but easy. Despite her relentless efforts, Myeong remains relatively unknown in the industry. Ironically, Myeong's name means fame, which only adds to the frustration of her current situation. But one day, while wandering through the city, she stumbles upon a photo exhibition featuring stunning images of her younger self, captured by a mysterious photographer. As she gazes at the pictures, Myeong is transported back to a time when she was filled with hope and optimism. Seeing herself through the lens of another's perspective ignites a new fire within her. Could this photographer be the key to unlocking her potential and finally achieving the fame she was destined for? With newfound determination, Myeong sets out to find the photographer and learn more about the person behind the camera. As they begin to collaborate, sparks fly and Myeong begins to see herself in a whole new light. Will she be able to capture the attention of the industry as this photographer's muse? Only time will tell, but Myeong is ready to take on the challenge and prove that she's meant for greatness.",

Unfortunately she is only popular with her pupils, so her prospects of ever getting married seem... grim. And Yamato Kazuki, university student, 20 years old, future goals: marrying Kyouko, becoming an astronaut(?). He's been in love with Kyouko ever since she became his homeroom teacher in 4th grade. Now finally an adult and having enough money to buy a ring, he decides to propose to her and she—in some way or other—agrees to become his girlfriend. But even though theoretically a couple now, their teacher-student relationship doesn't seem to have changed much. What will become of this unlikely pair? (Source: Ciel Scans)",

          "synopsis": "Vivisepulture—the practice of burying a living person to accompany the deceased as a sacrifice—awaited Rieta Tristi following the passing of Casarius, the Count of Cevitas. Her sacrificial burial to appease the gods comes amidst a plague that has claimed the lives of many, including her first husband. Rieta's daughter had been sold into the slave trade by the same person who is now asking her to be buried alongside him. While she accepts her death sentence, the ceremony is interrupted by the Archduke of Axias Manor. The Archduke is an outcast of his empire, owing to widespread tales of bloodshed and merciless killing by his hands. He appears unannounced at Count Casarius' funeral to settle a debt, but he is disappointed when he is met with a wooden coffin instead. Seeing something intriguing in her gloomy demeanor, Archduke Axias requests for Rieta's life to be entrusted to him in exchange for debt forgiveness, which the late Count's son hastily accepts. Now a consort for Archduke Axias, Rieta must find new purpose in the second chance she is given. Adept in magic, she utilizes her skills to cast blessings for the residents within the castle walls. While she carries out these tasks, Rieta strives to understand the Archduke—who showed her kindness when no one else would. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As punishment for slacking on the job, the shinigami Lapan is ordered to go to the Human Realm in the body of a skeleton to retrieve a wandering soul. However, much to Lapan's lecherous delight, a slip-up lands his soul in the body of young Alice, a buxom student at a local all-girls school. With the skirt-chasing shinigami (as Alice) leaving a storm of sexual harassment allegations in his wake, whatever is poor beskeletoned Alice to do?! (Source: Yen Press)",

She worked hard to become a real daughter, and continued to work harder still. \"Duchess! The real lady is alive.\" \"Her name is... Helianne!\" Helga prayed to God and begged that the real daughter didn't return to take her place. \"...Return, Helianne.\" \"Please don't return, I beg you.\" Helga wondered, was it because she was a fake that her pleas did not reach God? \"Dear God, I have prayed to you countless times, haven't I? I implore you; do not let her return.\" She shouted these prayers again and again until her throat turned hoarse; but it was in vain. The child who will ruin my whole world... The duke family's real daughter, Helianne. The real daughter has returned. (Source: Kakao Entertainment Corp., translated)",

When the nurse walks in on the scene, devilishly handsome Taehyun tells her that Dayeol tried to make out with him.

To make matters worse, Taehyun doesn't show the slightest bit of remorse; in fact, he shamelessly begins hanging around Dayeol.

But when all else fails, it falls to Hyeonbok to defeat the dungeon bosses or die trying. Luckily, he's not alone. With the help of his skeleton friends (and a gift from a mysterious benefactor), he develops his rare talent for magic while learning about bravery and friendship. Hyeonbok seems ready to face whatever the dungeon throws at him... but is he? (Source: Tapas Media)",

After a night of heavy drinking to wash away the pain, she wakes up the next morning in the bed of Sir Theodore, more widely known as the kingdom's mad dog! Adding more to the confusion, Theodore keeps calling Elle his \"master\" and has been appointed as the deputy commander's aide without her knowledge. But despite his wolfish reputation, Theodore acts oddly tame when it comes to the dame he serves. Just what intentions could this knight be hiding behind his sharp-toothed grin? (Source: Tappytoon)",

Ready to throw herself into enemy lines against all orders, there is only one thing she fears; the allied reptilian medic, Captain Ruce Duval. While \"Red\" is ready to put herself in harm's way for the sake of her comrades, her reckless tactics always send her back into the clutches of the twisted captain. Even in the midst of battle, these two seem to always run into each other. While Ruce can't keep her hands to herself, Red can't figure out why Ruce keeps running through her mind. But this growing interest soon traps Red like a leash around her neck. As passions spark and boundaries are pushed, how long before this wet-nosed virgin is swept up by her scaly superior?
