Meanwhile, Lala's little sister Momo also falls in love with Rito and works on building a harem for him in hopes of giving herself a place in Rito's love life. To do so she enrolls in his school to secretly support all of Rito's love interests and even attempts to find him more, including the recently enrolled alien assassin Konjiki no Yami, also known as \"Yami,\" who puts off her next bounty because of him. However, Kurosaki Mea, Yami's little sister, intends for Yami to return to being an assassin. To LOVE-Ru Darkness continues from the events of To LOVE-Ru with new girls, new foes, and even more lewd moments. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Mercenary Cloud Strife and his allies have prevented an apocalyptic attack from the psychotic Sephiroth, but human civilization remains in tatters. Furthermore, each member of Avalanche, the victorious rebel group, struggles with a growing emptiness and a lack of purpose in their new reality. Cloud's childhood friend Tifa Lockhart, who feels responsible for the loss of innocent lives, desperately tries to sustain her relationship with him. Still, the burden of their dead companions leads to a growing rift between them. Meanwhile, Barret Wallace and Red XIII search for a new ambition now that the threat of Sephiroth has passed, and Yuffie Kisaragi returns to her home nation of Wutai to help its citizens combat a new disease known as Geostigma. But somewhere in the lifestream—the collective spiritual energy of the world and all who have died on its surface—lurks the remnants of Sephiroth's vengeful spirit, left to stew in its hatred toward Cloud and the rest of the human race. And while the soul of someone dear to Cloud monitors Sephiroth's growing animosity, the villain's revenge plot continues to spiral closer to completion. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Tales of faraway places, violent wars and the curious people who fought in them have reached his ears, but seem so foreign compared to his rural home. Life for Kenta is stable, safe and altogether uneventful that is, until fate decides to strike. Kenta suddenly finds himself in the midst of a battle, fighting for possession of a girl he has never met and about whom he knows nothing. He feels compelled to protect this young stranger who seems to strike fear into those around her no matter what the costs may be. (Source: ANN) This series is on hiatus.",

          "synopsis": "Ten years ago, a gigantic demon beast known as the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox was released from its jinchuuriki by an unknown shinobi wearing a mask. The village of Konohagakure was close to destruction by the attack of the Nine-Tails, but the village was saved by its leader. Minato Namikaze and his wife Kushina Uzumaki—who was the jinchuuriki at the time of the attack—sealed away the demon inside their new born son: Naruto Uzumaki. However, this act of saving the village cost them their lives and they left the future of the ninja world to Naruto. With the demon fox sealed away, things continued as normal. However, the peace of the village would not last long, for Pain, Konan, Itachi Uchiha, Kisame Hoshigaki, Sasori, Deidara, Hidan and Kakuzu—members of a dreaded shinobi group called the Akatsuki—attacked Konohagakure. Naruto narrowly manages to launch a counter-attack but why have these shinobi appeared when all of them were meant to have died? The mystery remains, but the shinobi are praised by heir families for completing such a dangerous mission. However, one of them who has never known the faces of his parents, Naruto, cannot help but feel lonely. At that exact time, suddenly, the masked man makes his appearance in Konoha. Naruto and his allies are both attacked by the man's mysterious new doujutsu. (Source: Naruto Wikia)",

Unfortunately, now their job is looking to staff an office in Siberia, and non-married employees are the first to be considered. Rika is desperate to avoid the transfer and goes to Takuya with an idea: if they pretend they're getting married in a year, they can stay in Tokyo. The only problem is the two of them barely know each other! If these two quiet coworkers \"fake\" a relationship, will it turn into something real? (Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

The android production company SA Corp. produced Giftia, a new kind of android that has the most amount of emotion and human-like qualities out of any other model ever seen. However, due to problems in technology, the androids have a service life, and once they pass that, it gets pretty bad. For this reason, SA Corp. creates a terminal service in order to retrieve Giftia that have gone past their service life. A new employee at the terminal service named Tsukasa Mizugaki forms a team with the Giftia Isla to retrieve the other androids. (Source: ANN)",

          "synopsis": "After being told to return, a 25-year-old man furiously drives back home with a hefty amount of cargo on his truck. During his road trip, he encounters a young man with a single bag, standing in the middle of nowhere requesting assistance to get to the sea. Despite believing the teenager will only be a nuisance, he reluctantly decides to give him a lift. But as they draw closer to the sea, the two slowly share their differences and start to take a liking to each other. Little does the older man know, there is more to the kid than meets the eye.
