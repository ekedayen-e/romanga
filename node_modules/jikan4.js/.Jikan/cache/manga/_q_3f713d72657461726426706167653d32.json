          "synopsis": "Throughout elementary school, Sayaka Saeki has prided herself on being the ideal child. By achieving good grades, participating in various extracurricular activities, and demonstrating model etiquette, she thought her life was going exactly as planned. However, after receiving a romantic confession from a girl in her swim class, Sayaka realizes how emotions can defy her logical, straightforward thinking. Wanting to cooperate rather than compete with peers at the start of middle school, Sayaka's shift in perspective leads her to befriend her senior Chie Yuzuki. As the two form a gentle bond, Yuzuki confesses her feelings to Sayaka, who reciprocates her affection in hopes of learning the significance of love. Despite sacrificing her devotion to academics, their relationship ends, leaving Sayaka scarred with resentment. Swearing to never let her feelings take control of her life again, Sayaka vows to revive her independence in high school. But when class representative Touko Nanami captures her eye, Sayaka must settle her struggle between accepting her genuine self or pursuing her logical way of life. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "It is just another ordinary day for Satoru Mikami. The sun is shining brightly on the streets of Tokyo, and he is in the midst of a discussion with his colleagues when suddenly he gets stabbed by a passing robber. The average 37-year-old corporate worker is now at death's door, and he has only one regret—dying a virgin. Fading out, he is startled by a mysterious AI-like voice reciting commands. Satoru abruptly wakes up in the middle of a strange cave, but something odd has happened: he is now a goop of slime! Thanks to his new body, he has acquired the skill to absorb anything and obtain its appearance and abilities. While testing out his newfound powers and exploring the cave, he stumbles upon a massive dragon named Veldora, who has been sealed away for the past three hundred years. After quickly befriending the beast, Satoru decides to help him escape; in exchange, Satoru is bestowed a new name: \"Rimuru Tempest.\" Wishing to avoid a life like his boring and mundane past, Rimuru is about to set out on a grand quest that will change his own destiny and the fate of his new world.

However, it soon becomes clear that Tsuyoshi has been dragged into the summoning ritual by accident. His only skill turns out to be \"Online Supermarket,\" which allows him to open an interface where he can purchase and obtain food-related supermarket items from modern Japan. Unceremoniously booted out of the palace, Tsuyoshi sets out on his own into his new world. However, his ability to create delicious dishes unknown to this world soon pays dividends, even attracting the legendary wolf Fenrir. Fenrir is so taken in by the food that the creature immediately forms a contract with Tsuyoshi, becoming his familiar. Followed by this whimsical mythical being, Tsuyoshi takes up a job as a merchant and adventurer, traveling and cooking up mouth-watering meals that never fail to amaze the inhabitants of this world.

          "synopsis": "Yuuta Togashi is a high school freshman who chose a new school far away from his middle school, due to his mortifying past there. Yuuta was what people would classify as a chuunibyou—a \"disease\" that causes people to fantasize about themselves and their surroundings—with him using the alias of \"Dark Flame Master.\" He enters high school looking to start anew or, at least, that is what he hoped for. Everything had been going smoothly, and Yuuta was relishing the feeling of a normal high school life until he met Rikka Takanashi—who despite being a high schooler, is still a chuunibyou—subsequently crumbling Yuuta's short-lived regular high school experience. It would seem that his chuunibyou past is not leaving him just yet. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! follows Yuuta and Rikka's relationship as they experience an eccentric high school journey, with chuunibyou constantly haunting Yuuta. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "To utilize the seemingly endless supply of magic in a nearby power spot, the Prussian princess Dianeia attempts to extract its energies alongside her order of mages. However, to the group's confusion, this procedure inadvertently summons a house from another world that happens to be linked to the same power spot. Due to the house's connection to the power spot, Daichi, its sole inhabitant, has been absorbing magical power since his childhood. As a result, he is remarkably stronger than any other being in this new place he has been transported to. Unaware of his own abilities, Daichi carelessly manifests them, making a lasting impression on Dianeia and her companions. Despite wishing for a life of leisure, Daichi realizes that his presence in this realm will only attract similarly mighty entities toward him. Consequently, the balance of power will be inevitably disrupted—not only in Prussia but in the rest of the world as well. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Mukouda Tsuyoshi was nothing special in modern Japan, so when he was summoned to a world of swordplay and sorcery, he thought he was ready for the adventure of a lifetime. Too bad the kingdom that summoned him only got him by mistake! Not only was he not one of the three summoned heroes, but his stats were laughable compared to theirs. On top of that, there's something really sketchy about this kingdom... \"Ah, these people are the kind to try and use the Hero,\" he realized, and immediately left to make his own way in this other world. The only thing Mukouda can rely on is his unique skill: the \"Online Supermarket,\" a skill that allows him to buy modern goods in a fantasy world. It's useless for combat, but if he plays his cards right, he could lead a comfortable life, maybe? At least, that's what Mukouda thinks, but it turns out modern food bought with this skill has some absurd effects! What happens when Mukouda introduces ridiculously tasty modern cooking to a fantasy world like this? He gets some ridiculous repeat customers begging for more...! (Source: J-Novel Club)",

Due to some unforeseen circumstances by those guys who summoned me, they quickly ran away. Be that as it may, there are still some ill-mannered people who covet the magic leaking out of my house.
