They were childhood friends up until he kissed her and left for America, and the thought of that jerk coming back has her so distracted that she gets caught in a wave and almost drowns! She would've died, too, if it weren't for that mysterious boy with a tattoo... He cut himself so badly to save her, and he left her with the kind of ring a boy would give to his gilrfriend -- but she never saw his face. Later in the day, Shiori spies a hot pro surfer from America... named Riichi! He's back, and he still wants to date Shiori, and... how did he get that terrible cut...? 2. An Insolent Romance Satsuki comes to the bar every day just to watch the seductive bar tender, Yahagi. Rumor has it he changes his cologne every time he changes women. Just as Satsuki begins to understand that she has no chance with him, she's approached by a pervert... and then saved by Yahagi, who says that Satsuki is his woman!? What is this farce? He says he wants to wear her scent -- but only until Valentine's Day. He's using Satsuki to keep his (jealous!) female fans at bay. This can only mean trouble for Satsuki... 3. C-Shock / Culture Shock Honoka has lost her luggage and her way in Shibuya station. In unfamiliar territory, she gets approached by a group of perverts... and then saved by Shiino, a gang member who practically owns the territory! Honoka is worse off than she was before, because as thanks for saving her, Shiino decides he'll take her virginity!? That's when Honoka does something no woman has ever done before... and it could cost her a lot more than her virginity! (Source: ShoujoMagic)",

Then she would be able to do all the thing she couldn't until now, like smoking cigarettes, eating sweets and falling in love. She meets her neighbour, a 52-year-old college professor for German Language. Much to her surprise she falls in love with him and after her spontaneous confession a complicated love story unfolds, where Kiwako learns that in times you hate the person you love.

Hiro tries to ignore the torturous crush that he has on his younger co-worker, because Uchida is dead-set on getting a girlfriend. To Hiro's surprise, it turns out that they both need to come to terms with the attraction they have for one another. Then, there's Segawa and Honda. Honda is terrified that Segawa might realize the pent-up feelings he has for the boy . . . but even Honda never prepared himself for just how boldly Segawa might behave on an impromptu jaunt on a motorcycle! What about Maki and Tatsumi? Stuck in a relationship with the dominant, obsessive cosplayer Maki, Tatsumi is frustrated. But are his claims of wanting a life free of his lover really true? These couples, as well as others, in LOVE, ETC. are about to realize that it's impossible to deny fate--or passion--for very long. (Netcomics)",

Why is it that another person can affect someone else so strongly? When a powerful man is fickle, he is allowed to be. But if a woman is unfaithful, she is called a tramp. Koi tells the realistic stories of six different women of different ages, and completely different outlooks on life. (Source: Be With You Scans)",

          "synopsis": "Love Seeker vol 1 is a series of two stories and one extra. While the two stories have little to do with each other, there are characters who are a part of each of the stories. Story 1 (chapter 1-2) Tomura is an office geek; small, shy, and someone easily picked on/forced to finish other people's work. He has decided to finally confess his love to his female co-worker Shinoyama. Mistakenly though, he ends up confessing his love to Miura Keijirou because he took off his glasses. Keijirou is Tomura's opposite; handsome, tall and the girls love him. After going out for a meal Keijirou offers to help Tomura by being his \"love messenger\". Will Keijirou really be of help, or will he be more of a hindrance to Tomura? Story 2 (chapter 3-4) Nanjo is asked by his friend Kenji to be a replacement gigolo for him. After giving Nanjo the information Kenji bolts so Nanjo can't refuse the job. It turns out that Kyousuke, the client, buys gigolos just to talk to. Because of his position where he works it's hard for him to find someone he can just talk to. With Nanjo's egotistical and blunt way of speaking will this one night job last as long as it should, or is this the start of a wonderful friendship? Extra story (chapter 5) Misaki is an average business man. One night trying to get away from someone he runs into a fast food place and ends up crying in front of Fujita, an employee. Ever since then Misaki goes there after work ordering the same thing. Seeing how the girls swarm to Fujita, Misaki becomes annoyed that the girls cannot see the true Fujita...or is he not realizing what his real feelings for Fujita are? (Source: M-U)",
